              "'Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a set of data computationally, to create a subset (a summary) that represents the most important or relevant information within the original content.\\n\\nIn addition to text, images and videos can also be summarized. Text summarization finds the most informative sentences in a document;[1] image summarization finds the most representative images within an image collection[citation needed]; video summarization extracts the most important frames from the video content.[2]\\n\\nThere are two general approaches to automatic summarization: extraction and abstraction.\\n\\nHere, content is extracted from the original data, but the extracted content is not modified in any way. Examples of extracted content include key-phrases that can be used to \"tag\" or index a text document, or key sentences (including headings) that collectively comprise an abstract, and representative images or video segments, as stated above. For text, extraction is analogous to the process of skimming, where the summary (if available), headings and subheadings, figures, the first and last paragraphs of a section, and optionally the first and last sentences in a paragraph are read before one chooses to read the entire document in detail.[3] Other examples of extraction that include key sequences of text in terms of clinical relevance (including patient/problem, intervention, and outcome).[4]\\n\\nThis has been applied mainly for text. Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content, and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. Abstraction may transform the extracted content by paraphrasing sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both natural language processing and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge. \"Paraphrasing\" is even more difficult to apply to image and video, which is why most summarization systems are extractive.\\n\\nApproaches aimed at higher summarization quality rely on combined software and human effort. In Machine Aided Human Summarization, extractive techniques highlight candidate passages for inclusion (to which the human adds or removes text). In Human Aided Machine Summarization, a human post-processes software output, in the same way that one edits the output of automatic translation by Google Translate.\\n\\nThere are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. The first is generic summarization, which focuses on obtaining a generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.). The second is query relevant summarization, sometimes called query-based summarization, which summarizes objects specific to a query. Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.\\n\\nAn example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document. Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example, a cluster of articles on the same topic). This problem is called multi-document summarization. A related application is summarizing news articles. Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary.\\n\\nImage collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization. It consists in selecting a representative set of images from a larger set of images.[5] A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an image collection exploration system. Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video. This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.\\n\\nAt a very high level, summarization algorithms try to find subsets of objects (like set of sentences, or a set of images), which cover information of the entire set. This is also called the core-set. These algorithms model notions like diversity, coverage, information and representativeness of the summary. Query based summarization techniques, additionally model for relevance of the summary with the query. Some techniques and algorithms which naturally model summarization problems are TextRank and PageRank, Submodular set function, Determinantal point process, maximal marginal relevance (MMR) etc.\\n\\nThe task is the following. You are given a piece of text, such as a journal article, and you must produce a list of keywords or key[phrase]s that capture the primary topics discussed in the text.[6] In the case of research articles, many authors provide manually assigned keywords, but most text lacks pre-existing keyphrases. For example, news articles rarely have keyphrases attached, but it would be useful to be able to automatically do so for a number of applications discussed below. Consider the example text from a news article:\\n\\nA keyphrase extractor might select \"Army Corps of Engineers\", \"President Bush\", \"New Orleans\", and \"defective flood-control pumps\" as keyphrases. These are pulled directly from the text. In contrast, an abstractive keyphrase system would somehow internalize the content and generate keyphrases that do not appear in the text, but more closely resemble what a human might produce, such as \"political negligence\" or \"inadequate protection from floods\". Abstraction requires a deep understanding of the text, which makes it difficult for a computer system. Keyphrases have many applications. They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary, improve information retrieval (if documents have keyphrases assigned, a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a full-text search), and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus.\\n\\nDepending on the different literature and the definition of key terms, words or phrases, keyword extraction is a highly related theme.\\n\\nBeginning with the work of Turney,[7] many researchers have approached keyphrase extraction as a supervised machine learning problem. Given a document, we construct an example for each unigram, bigram, and trigram found in the text (though other text units are also possible, as discussed below). We then compute various features describing each example (e.g., does the phrase begin with an upper-case letter?). We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents. Using the known keyphrases, we can assign positive or negative labels to the examples. Then we learn a classifier that can discriminate between positive and negative examples as a function of the features. Some classifiers make a binary classification for a test example, while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase. For instance, in the above text, we might learn a rule that says phrases with initial capital letters are likely to be keyphrases. After training a learner, we can select keyphrases for test documents in the following manner. We apply the same example-generation strategy to the test documents, then run each example through the learner. We can determine the keyphrases by looking at binary classification decisions or probabilities returned from our learned model. If probabilities are given, a threshold is used to select the keyphrases. Keyphrase extractors are generally evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures how many of the proposed keyphrases are actually correct. Recall measures how many of the true keyphrases your system proposed. The two measures can be combined in an F-score, which is the harmonic mean of the two (F = 2PR/(P + R) ). Matches between the proposed keyphrases and the known keyphrases can be checked after stemming or applying some other text normalization.\\n\\nDesigning a supervised keyphrase extraction system involves deciding on several choices (some of these apply to unsupervised, too). The first choice is exactly how to generate examples. Turney and others have used all possible unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams without intervening punctuation and after removing stopwords. Hulth showed that you can get some improvement by selecting examples to be sequences of tokens that match certain patterns of part-of-speech tags. Ideally, the mechanism for generating examples produces all the known labeled keyphrases as candidates, though this is often not the case. For example, if we use only unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, then we will never be able to extract a known keyphrase containing four words. Thus, recall may suffer. However, generating too many examples can also lead to low precision.\\n\\nWe also need to create features that describe the examples and are informative enough to allow a learning algorithm to discriminate keyphrases from non- keyphrases. Typically features involve various term frequencies (how many times a phrase appears in the current text or in a larger corpus), the length of the example, relative position of the first occurrence, various boolean syntactic features (e.g., contains all caps), etc. The Turney paper used about 12 such features. Hulth uses a reduced set of features, which were found most successful in the KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) work derived from Turney’s seminal paper.\\n\\nIn the end, the system will need to return a list of keyphrases for a test document, so we need to have a way to limit the number. Ensemble methods (i.e., using votes from several classifiers) have been used to produce numeric scores that can be thresholded to provide a user-provided number of keyphrases. This is the technique used by Turney with C4.5 decision trees. Hulth used a single binary classifier so the learning algorithm implicitly determines the appropriate number.\\n\\nOnce examples and features are created, we need a way to learn to predict keyphrases. Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used, such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, and rule induction. In the case of Turney\\'s GenEx algorithm, a genetic algorithm is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm. The extractor follows a series of heuristics to identify keyphrases. The genetic algorithm optimizes parameters for these heuristics with respect to performance on training documents with known key phrases.\\n\\nAnother keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank. While supervised methods have some nice properties, like being able to produce interpretable rules for what features characterize a keyphrase, they also require a large amount of training data. Many documents with known keyphrases are needed. Furthermore, training on a specific domain tends to customize the extraction process to that domain, so the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable, as some of Turney\\'s results demonstrate. Unsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data. It approaches the problem from a different angle. Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases, the TextRank algorithm[8] exploits the structure of the text itself to determine keyphrases that appear \"central\" to the text in the same way that PageRank selects important Web pages. Recall this is based on the notion of \"prestige\" or \"recommendation\" from social networks. In this way, TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all, but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text, and it can produce output simply based on the text\\'s intrinsic properties. Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages.\\n\\nTextRank is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm for NLP. Essentially, it runs PageRank on a graph specially designed for a particular NLP task. For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices. Edges are based on some measure of semantic or lexical similarity between the text unit vertices. Unlike PageRank, the edges are typically undirected and can be weighted to reflect a degree of similarity. Once the graph is constructed, it is used to form a stochastic matrix, combined with a damping factor (as in the \"random surfer model\"), and the ranking over vertices is obtained by finding the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 (i.e., the stationary distribution of the random walk on the graph).\\n\\nThe vertices should correspond to what we want to rank. Potentially, we could do something similar to the supervised methods and create a vertex for each unigram, bigram, trigram, etc. However, to keep the graph small, the authors decide to rank individual unigrams in a first step, and then include a second step that merges highly ranked adjacent unigrams to form multi-word phrases. This has a nice side effect of allowing us to produce keyphrases of arbitrary length. For example, if we rank unigrams and find that \"advanced\", \"natural\", \"language\", and \"processing\" all get high ranks, then we would look at the original text and see that these words appear consecutively and create a final keyphrase using all four together. Note that the unigrams placed in the graph can be filtered by part of speech. The authors found that adjectives and nouns were the best to include. Thus, some linguistic knowledge comes into play in this step.\\n\\nEdges are created based on word co-occurrence in this application of TextRank. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the unigrams appear within a window of size N in the original text. N is typically around 2–10. Thus, \"natural\" and \"language\" might be linked in a text about NLP. \"Natural\" and \"processing\" would also be linked because they would both appear in the same string of N words. These edges build on the notion of \"text cohesion\" and the idea that words that appear near each other are likely related in a meaningful way and \"recommend\" each other to the reader.\\n\\nSince this method simply ranks the individual vertices, we need a way to threshold or produce a limited number of keyphrases. The technique chosen is to set a count T to be a user-specified fraction of the total number of vertices in the graph. Then the top T vertices/unigrams are selected based on their stationary probabilities. A post- processing step is then applied to merge adjacent instances of these T unigrams. As a result, potentially more or less than T final keyphrases will be produced, but the number should be roughly proportional to the length of the original text.\\n\\nIt is not initially clear why applying PageRank to a co-occurrence graph would produce useful keyphrases. One way to think about it is the following. A word that appears multiple times throughout a text may have many different co-occurring neighbors. For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram \"learning\" might co-occur with \"machine\", \"supervised\", \"un-supervised\", and \"semi-supervised\" in four different sentences. Thus, the \"learning\" vertex would be a central \"hub\" that connects to these other modifying words. Running PageRank/TextRank on the graph is likely to rank \"learning\" highly. Similarly, if the text contains the phrase \"supervised classification\", then there would be an edge between \"supervised\" and \"classification\". If \"classification\" appears several other places and thus has many neighbors, its importance would contribute to the importance of \"supervised\". If it ends up with a high rank, it will be selected as one of the top T unigrams, along with \"learning\" and probably \"classification\". In the final post-processing step, we would then end up with keyphrases \"supervised learning\" and \"supervised classification\".\\n\\nIn short, the co-occurrence graph will contain densely connected regions for terms that appear often and in different contexts. A random walk on this graph will have a stationary distribution that assigns large probabilities to the terms in the centers of the clusters. This is similar to densely connected Web pages getting ranked highly by PageRank. This approach has also been used in document summarization, considered below.\\n\\nLike keyphrase extraction, document summarization aims to identify the essence of a text. The only real difference is that now we are dealing with larger text units—whole sentences instead of words and phrases.\\n\\nBefore getting into the details of some summarization methods, we will mention how summarization systems are typically evaluated. The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure. This is a recall-based measure that determines how well a system-generated summary covers the content present in one or more human-generated model summaries known as references. It is recall-based to encourage systems to include all the important topics in the text. Recall can be computed with respect to unigram, bigram, trigram, or 4-gram matching. For example, ROUGE-1 is computed as division of count of unigrams in reference that appear in system and count of unigrams in reference summary.\\n\\nIf there are multiple references, the ROUGE-1 scores are averaged. Because ROUGE is based only on content overlap, it can determine if the same general concepts are discussed between an automatic summary and a reference summary, but it cannot determine if the result is coherent or the sentences flow together in a sensible manner. High-order n-gram ROUGE measures try to judge fluency to some degree. Note that ROUGE is similar to the BLEU measure for machine translation, but BLEU is precision- based, because translation systems favor accuracy.\\n\\nA promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization.[9] The idea of adaptive summarization involves preliminary recognition of document/text genre and subsequent application of summarization algorithms optimized for this genre. First summarizes that perform adaptive summarization have been created.[10]\\n\\nSupervised text summarization is very much like supervised keyphrase extraction. Basically, if you have a collection of documents and human-generated summaries for them, you can learn features of sentences that make them good candidates for inclusion in the summary. Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc. The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\". This is not typically how people create summaries, so simply using journal abstracts or existing summaries is usually not sufficient. The sentences in these summaries do not necessarily match up with sentences in the original text, so it would be difficult to assign labels to examples for training. Note, however, that these natural summaries can still be used for evaluation purposes, since ROUGE-1 only cares about unigrams.\\n\\nDuring the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, TNO developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain. The system was based on a hybrid system using a naive Bayes classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a maximum entropy (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain.\\n\\nThe unsupervised approach to summarization is also quite similar in spirit to unsupervised keyphrase extraction and gets around the issue of costly training data. Some unsupervised summarization approaches are based on finding a \"centroid\" sentence, which is the mean word vector of all the sentences in the document. Then the sentences can be ranked with regard to their similarity to this centroid sentence.\\n\\nA more principled way to estimate sentence importance is using random walks and eigenvector centrality. LexRank[11] is an algorithm essentially identical to TextRank, and both use this approach for document summarization. The two methods were developed by different groups at the same time, and LexRank simply focused on summarization, but could just as easily be used for keyphrase extraction or any other NLP ranking task.\\n\\nIn both LexRank and TextRank, a graph is constructed by creating a vertex for each sentence in the document.\\n\\nThe edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap. While LexRank uses cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors, TextRank uses a very similar measure based on the number of words two sentences have in common (normalized by the sentences\\' lengths). The LexRank paper explored using unweighted edges after applying a threshold to the cosine values, but also experimented with using edges with weights equal to the similarity score. TextRank uses continuous similarity scores as weights.\\n\\nIn both algorithms, the sentences are ranked by applying PageRank to the resulting graph. A summary is formed by combining the top ranking sentences, using a threshold or length cutoff to limit the size of the summary.\\n\\nIt is worth noting that TextRank was applied to summarization exactly as described here, while LexRank was used as part of a larger summarization system (MEAD) that combines the LexRank score (stationary probability) with other features like sentence position and length using a linear combination with either user-specified or automatically tuned weights. In this case, some training documents might be needed, though the TextRank results show the additional features are not absolutely necessary.\\n\\nAnother important distinction is that TextRank was used for single document summarization, while LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization. The task remains the same in both cases—only the number of sentences to choose from has grown. However, when summarizing multiple documents, there is a greater risk of selecting duplicate or highly redundant sentences to place in the same summary. Imagine you have a cluster of news articles on a particular event, and you want to produce one summary. Each article is likely to have many similar sentences, and you would only want to include distinct ideas in the summary. To address this issue, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step that builds up a summary by adding sentences in rank order, but discards any sentences that are too similar to ones already placed in the summary. The method used is called Cross-Sentence Information Subsumption (CSIS).\\n\\nThese methods work based on the idea that sentences \"recommend\" other similar sentences to the reader. Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance. The importance of this sentence also stems from the importance of the sentences \"recommending\" it. Thus, to get ranked highly and placed in a summary, a sentence must be similar to many sentences that are in turn also similar to many other sentences. This makes intuitive sense and allows the algorithms to be applied to any arbitrary new text. The methods are domain-independent and easily portable. One could imagine the features indicating important sentences in the news domain might vary considerably from the biomedical domain. However, the unsupervised \"recommendation\"-based approach applies to any domain.\\n\\nMulti-document summarization is an automatic procedure aimed at extraction of information from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the news aggregators performing the next step down the road of coping with information overload. Multi-document summarization may also be done in response to a question.[12] [4]\\n\\nMulti-document summarization creates information reports that are both concise and comprehensive. With different opinions being put together and outlined, every topic is described from multiple perspectives within a single document. While the goal of a brief summary is to simplify information search and cut the time by pointing to the most relevant source documents, comprehensive multi-document summary should itself contain the required information, hence limiting the need for accessing original files to cases when refinement is required. Automatic summaries present information extracted from multiple sources algorithmically, without any editorial touch or subjective human intervention, thus making it completely unbiased.[dubious – discuss]\\n\\nMulti-document extractive summarization faces a problem of potential redundancy. Ideally, we would like to extract sentences that are both \"central\" (i.e., contain the main ideas) and \"diverse\" (i.e., they differ from one another). LexRank deals with diversity as a heuristic final stage using CSIS, and other systems have used similar methods, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR),[13] in trying to eliminate redundancy in information retrieval results. There is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm like Page/Lex/TextRank that handles both \"centrality\" and \"diversity\" in a unified mathematical framework based on absorbing Markov chain random walks. (An absorbing random walk is like a standard random walk, except some states are now absorbing states that act as \"black holes\" that cause the walk to end abruptly at that state.) The algorithm is called GRASSHOPPER.[14] In addition to explicitly promoting diversity during the ranking process, GRASSHOPPER incorporates a prior ranking (based on sentence position in the case of summarization).\\n\\nThe state of the art results for multi-document summarization, however, are obtained using mixtures of submodular functions. These methods have achieved the state of the art results for Document Summarization Corpora, DUC 04 - 07.[15] Similar results were also achieved with the use of determinantal point processes (which are a special case of submodular functions) for DUC-04.[16]\\n\\nA new method for multi-lingual multi-document summarization that avoids redundancy works by simplifying and generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence in each document and then evaluates similarity \"qualitatively\" by comparing the shape and position of said ideograms has recently been developed. This tool does not use word frequency, does not need training or preprocessing of any kind and works by generating ideograms that represent the meaning of each sentence and then summarizes using two user-supplied parameters: equivalence (when are two sentences to be considered equivalent) and relevance (how long is the desired summary).\\n\\nThe idea of a submodular set function has recently emerged as a powerful modeling tool for various summarization problems. Submodular functions naturally model notions of coverage, information, representation and diversity. Moreover, several important combinatorial optimization problems occur as special instances of submodular optimization. For example, the set cover problem is a special case of submodular optimization, since the set cover function is submodular. The set cover function attempts to find a subset of objects which cover a given set of concepts. For example, in document summarization, one would like the summary to cover all important and relevant concepts in the document. This is an instance of set cover. Similarly, the facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity. Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a determinantal point process to model diversity. Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular. Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.\\n\\nWhile submodular functions are fitting problems for summarization, they also admit very efficient algorithms for optimization. For example, a simple greedy algorithm admits a constant factor guarantee.[17] Moreover, the greedy algorithm is extremely simple to implement and can scale to large datasets, which is very important for summarization problems.\\n\\nSubmodular functions have achieved state-of-the-art for almost all summarization problems. For example, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2012[18] shows that submodular functions achieve the best results to date on DUC-04, DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 systems for document summarization. Similarly, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2011,[19] shows that many existing systems for automatic summarization are instances of submodular functions. This was a breakthrough result establishing submodular functions as the right models for summarization problems.[citation needed]\\n\\nSubmodular Functions have also been used for other summarization tasks. Tschiatschek et al., 2014 show[20] that mixtures of submodular functions achieve state-of-the-art results for image collection summarization. Similarly, Bairi et al., 2015[21] show the utility of submodular functions for summarizing multi-document topic hierarchies. Submodular Functions have also successfully been used for summarizing machine learning datasets.[22]\\n• The Reddit bot \"autotldr\",[23] created in 2011 summarizes news articles in the comment-section of reddit posts. It was found to be very useful by the reddit community which upvoted its summaries hundreds of thousands of times.[24] The name is reference to TL;DR − Internet slang for \"too long; didn\\'t read\".[25][26]\\n\\nThe most common way to evaluate the informativeness of automatic summaries is to compare them with human-made model summaries.\\n\\nEvaluation techniques fall into intrinsic and extrinsic,[27] inter-textual and intra-textual.[28]\\n\\nAn intrinsic evaluation tests the summarization system in and of itself while an extrinsic evaluation tests the summarization based on how it affects the completion of some other task. Intrinsic evaluations have assessed mainly the coherence and informativeness of summaries. Extrinsic evaluations, on the other hand, have tested the impact of summarization on tasks like relevance assessment, reading comprehension, etc.\\n\\nIntra-textual methods assess the output of a specific summarization system, and the inter-textual ones focus on contrastive analysis of outputs of several summarization systems.\\n\\nHuman judgement often has wide variance on what is considered a \"good\" summary, which means that making the evaluation process automatic is particularly difficult. Manual evaluation can be used, but this is both time and labor-intensive as it requires humans to read not only the summaries but also the source documents. Other issues are those concerning coherence and coverage.\\n\\nOne of the metrics used in NIST\\'s annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [2]). It essentially calculates n-gram overlaps between automatically generated summaries and previously-written human summaries. A high level of overlap should indicate a high level of shared concepts between the two summaries. Note that overlap metrics like this are unable to provide any feedback on a summary\\'s coherence. Anaphor resolution remains another problem yet to be fully solved. Similarly, for image summarization, Tschiatschek et al., developed a Visual-ROUGE score which judges the performance of algorithms for image summarization.[29]\\n\\nDomain independent summarization techniques generally apply sets of general features which can be used to identify information-rich text segments. Recent research focus has drifted to domain-specific summarization techniques that utilize the available knowledge specific to the domain of text. For example, automatic summarization research on medical text generally attempts to utilize the various sources of codified medical knowledge and ontologies.[30]\\n\\nThe main drawback of the evaluation systems existing so far is that we need at least one reference summary, and for some methods more than one, to be able to compare automatic summaries with models. This is a hard and expensive task. Much effort has to be done in order to have corpus of texts and their corresponding summaries. Furthermore, for some methods, not only do we need to have human-made summaries available for comparison, but also manual annotation has to be performed in some of them (e.g. SCU in the Pyramid Method). In any case, what the evaluation methods need as an input, is a set of summaries to serve as gold standards and a set of automatic summaries. Moreover, they all perform a quantitative evaluation with regard to different similarity metrics.\\n\\nThe first publication in the area dates back to 1958 (Lun), starting with a statistical technique. Research increased significantly in 2015. Term frequency–inverse document frequency had been used by 2016. Pattern-based summarization was the most powerful option for multi-document summarization found by 2016. In the following year it was surpassed by latent semantic analysis (LSA) combined with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Although they did not replace other approaches and are often combined with them, by 2019 machine learning methods dominated the extractive summarization of single documents, which was considered to be nearing maturity. By 2020 the field was still very active and research is shifting towards abstractive summation and real-time summarization.[31]\\n• None Roxana, Angheluta (2002).

              "This has been applied mainly for text. <mark>Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation of the original content, and then use this representation to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express.</mark> Abstraction may transform the extracted content by paraphrasing sections of the source document, to condense a text more strongly than extraction. <mark>Such transformation, however, is computationally much more challenging than extraction, involving both natural language processing and often a deep understanding of the domain of the original text in cases where the original document relates to a special field of knowledge.</mark> <mark>\"Paraphrasing\" is even more difficult to apply to image and video, which is why most summarization systems are extractive.</mark> Approaches aimed at higher summarization quality rely on combined software and human effort. In Machine Aided Human Summarization, extractive techniques highlight candidate passages for inclusion (to which the human adds or removes text). In Human Aided Machine Summarization, a human post-processes software output, in the same way that one edits the output of automatic translation by Google Translate. There are broadly two types of extractive summarization tasks depending on what the summarization program focuses on. <mark>The first is generic summarization, which focuses on obtaining a generic summary or abstract of the collection (whether documents, or sets of images, or videos, news stories etc.).</mark> The second is query relevant summarization, sometimes called query-based summarization, which summarizes objects specific to a query. <mark>Summarization systems are able to create both query relevant text summaries and generic machine-generated summaries depending on what the user needs.</mark> <mark>An example of a summarization problem is document summarization, which attempts to automatically produce an abstract from a given document.</mark> <mark>Sometimes one might be interested in generating a summary from a single source document, while others can use multiple source documents (for example, a cluster of articles on the same topic).</mark> This problem is called multi-document summarization. A related application is summarizing news articles. <mark>Imagine a system, which automatically pulls together news articles on a given topic (from the web), and concisely represents the latest news as a summary.</mark> <mark>Image collection summarization is another application example of automatic summarization.</mark> It consists in selecting a representative set of images from a larger set of images. <mark>[5] A summary in this context is useful to show the most representative images of results in an image collection exploration system.</mark> <mark>Video summarization is a related domain, where the system automatically creates a trailer of a long video.</mark> This also has applications in consumer or personal videos, where one might want to skip the boring or repetitive actions. <mark>Similarly, in surveillance videos, one would want to extract important and suspicious activity, while ignoring all the boring and redundant frames captured.</mark> <mark>At a very high level, summarization algorithms try to find subsets of objects (like set of sentences, or a set of images), which cover information of the entire set.</mark> This is also called the core-set. <mark>These algorithms model notions like diversity, coverage, information and representativeness of the summary.</mark> <mark>Query based summarization techniques, additionally model for relevance of the summary with the query.</mark> <mark>Some techniques and algorithms which naturally model summarization problems are TextRank and PageRank, Submodular set function, Determinantal point process, maximal marginal relevance (MMR) etc.</mark> The task is the following. You are given a piece of text, such as a journal article, and you must produce a list of keywords or key[phrase]s that capture the primary topics discussed in the text. [6] In the case of research articles, many authors provide manually assigned keywords, but most text lacks pre-existing keyphrases. <mark>For example, news articles rarely have keyphrases attached, but it would be useful to be able to automatically do so for a number of applications discussed below.</mark> Consider the example text from a news article:\n",
              "\n",
              "A keyphrase extractor might select \"Army Corps of Engineers\", \"President Bush\", \"New Orleans\", and \"defective flood-control pumps\" as keyphrases. These are pulled directly from the text. <mark>In contrast, an abstractive keyphrase system would somehow internalize the content and generate keyphrases that do not appear in the text, but more closely resemble what a human might produce, such as \"political negligence\" or \"inadequate protection from floods\".</mark> Abstraction requires a deep understanding of the text, which makes it difficult for a computer system. Keyphrases have many applications. <mark>They can enable document browsing by providing a short summary, improve information retrieval (if documents have keyphrases assigned, a user could search by keyphrase to produce more reliable hits than a full-text search), and be employed in generating index entries for a large text corpus.</mark> <mark>Depending on the different literature and the definition of key terms, words or phrases, keyword extraction is a highly related theme.</mark> <mark>Beginning with the work of Turney,[7] many researchers have approached keyphrase extraction as a supervised machine learning problem.</mark> <mark>Given a document, we construct an example for each unigram, bigram, and trigram found in the text (though other text units are also possible, as discussed below).</mark> We then compute various features describing each example (e.g., does the phrase begin with an upper-case letter?). <mark>We assume there are known keyphrases available for a set of training documents.</mark> Using the known keyphrases, we can assign positive or negative labels to the examples. Then we learn a classifier that can discriminate between positive and negative examples as a function of the features. <mark>Some classifiers make a binary classification for a test example, while others assign a probability of being a keyphrase.</mark> For instance, in the above text, we might learn a rule that says phrases with initial capital letters are likely to be keyphrases. After training a learner, we can select keyphrases for test documents in the following manner. We apply the same example-generation strategy to the test documents, then run each example through the learner. We can determine the keyphrases by looking at binary classification decisions or probabilities returned from our learned model. <mark>If probabilities are given, a threshold is used to select the keyphrases.</mark> Keyphrase extractors are generally evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures how many of the proposed keyphrases are actually correct. Recall measures how many of the true keyphrases your system proposed. The two measures can be combined in an F-score, which is the harmonic mean of the two (F = 2PR/(P + R) ). Matches between the proposed keyphrases and the known keyphrases can be checked after stemming or applying some other text normalization. Designing a supervised keyphrase extraction system involves deciding on several choices (some of these apply to unsupervised, too). The first choice is exactly how to generate examples. Turney and others have used all possible unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams without intervening punctuation and after removing stopwords. Hulth showed that you can get some improvement by selecting examples to be sequences of tokens that match certain patterns of part-of-speech tags. Ideally, the mechanism for generating examples produces all the known labeled keyphrases as candidates, though this is often not the case. <mark>For example, if we use only unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, then we will never be able to extract a known keyphrase containing four words.</mark> Thus, recall may suffer. However, generating too many examples can also lead to low precision. We also need to create features that describe the examples and are informative enough to allow a learning algorithm to discriminate keyphrases from non- keyphrases. <mark>Typically features involve various term frequencies (how many times a phrase appears in the current text or in a larger corpus), the length of the example, relative position of the first occurrence, various boolean syntactic features (e.g., contains all caps), etc.</mark> The Turney paper used about 12 such features. <mark>Hulth uses a reduced set of features, which were found most successful in the KEA (Keyphrase Extraction Algorithm) work derived from Turney’s seminal paper.</mark> In the end, the system will need to return a list of keyphrases for a test document, so we need to have a way to limit the number. <mark>Ensemble methods (i.e., using votes from several classifiers) have been used to produce numeric scores that can be thresholded to provide a user-provided number of keyphrases.</mark> This is the technique used by Turney with C4.5 decision trees. <mark>Hulth used a single binary classifier so the learning algorithm implicitly determines the appropriate number.</mark> <mark>Once examples and features are created, we need a way to learn to predict keyphrases.</mark> Virtually any supervised learning algorithm could be used, such as decision trees, Naive Bayes, and rule induction. <mark>In the case of Turney's GenEx algorithm, a genetic algorithm is used to learn parameters for a domain-specific keyphrase extraction algorithm.</mark> The extractor follows a series of heuristics to identify keyphrases. The genetic algorithm optimizes parameters for these heuristics with respect to performance on training documents with known key phrases. Another keyphrase extraction algorithm is TextRank. <mark>While supervised methods have some nice properties, like being able to produce interpretable rules for what features characterize a keyphrase, they also require a large amount of training data.</mark> Many documents with known keyphrases are needed. <mark>Furthermore, training on a specific domain tends to customize the extraction process to that domain, so the resulting classifier is not necessarily portable, as some of Turney's results demonstrate.</mark> Unsupervised keyphrase extraction removes the need for training data. It approaches the problem from a different angle. <mark>Instead of trying to learn explicit features that characterize keyphrases, the TextRank algorithm[8] exploits the structure of the text itself to determine keyphrases that appear \"central\" to the text in the same way that PageRank selects important Web pages.</mark> Recall this is based on the notion of \"prestige\" or \"recommendation\" from social networks. <mark>In this way, TextRank does not rely on any previous training data at all, but rather can be run on any arbitrary piece of text, and it can produce output simply based on the text's intrinsic properties.</mark> Thus the algorithm is easily portable to new domains and languages. TextRank is a general purpose graph-based ranking algorithm for NLP. Essentially, it runs PageRank on a graph specially designed for a particular NLP task. <mark>For keyphrase extraction, it builds a graph using some set of text units as vertices.</mark> <mark>Edges are based on some measure of semantic or lexical similarity between the text unit vertices.</mark> Unlike PageRank, the edges are typically undirected and can be weighted to reflect a degree of similarity. <mark>Once the graph is constructed, it is used to form a stochastic matrix, combined with a damping factor (as in the \"random surfer model\"), and the ranking over vertices is obtained by finding the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 (i.e., the stationary distribution of the random walk on the graph).</mark> The vertices should correspond to what we want to rank. <mark>Potentially, we could do something similar to the supervised methods and create a vertex for each unigram, bigram, trigram, etc.</mark> <mark>However, to keep the graph small, the authors decide to rank individual unigrams in a first step, and then include a second step that merges highly ranked adjacent unigrams to form multi-word phrases.</mark> This has a nice side effect of allowing us to produce keyphrases of arbitrary length. <mark>For example, if we rank unigrams and find that \"advanced\", \"natural\", \"language\", and \"processing\" all get high ranks, then we would look at the original text and see that these words appear consecutively and create a final keyphrase using all four together.</mark> Note that the unigrams placed in the graph can be filtered by part of speech. The authors found that adjectives and nouns were the best to include. Thus, some linguistic knowledge comes into play in this step. <mark>Edges are created based on word co-occurrence in this application of TextRank.</mark> <mark>Two vertices are connected by an edge if the unigrams appear within a window of size N in the original text.</mark> N is typically around 2–10. <mark>Thus, \"natural\" and \"language\" might be linked in a text about NLP.</mark> <mark>\"Natural\" and \"processing\" would also be linked because they would both appear in the same string of N words.</mark> <mark>These edges build on the notion of \"text cohesion\" and the idea that words that appear near each other are likely related in a meaningful way and \"recommend\" each other to the reader.</mark> <mark>Since this method simply ranks the individual vertices, we need a way to threshold or produce a limited number of keyphrases.</mark> The technique chosen is to set a count T to be a user-specified fraction of the total number of vertices in the graph. Then the top T vertices/unigrams are selected based on their stationary probabilities. A post- processing step is then applied to merge adjacent instances of these T unigrams. As a result, potentially more or less than T final keyphrases will be produced, but the number should be roughly proportional to the length of the original text. <mark>It is not initially clear why applying PageRank to a co-occurrence graph would produce useful keyphrases.</mark> One way to think about it is the following. <mark>A word that appears multiple times throughout a text may have many different co-occurring neighbors.</mark> <mark>For example, in a text about machine learning, the unigram \"learning\" might co-occur with \"machine\", \"supervised\", \"un-supervised\", and \"semi-supervised\" in four different sentences.</mark> Thus, the \"learning\" vertex would be a central \"hub\" that connects to these other modifying words. <mark>Running PageRank/TextRank on the graph is likely to rank \"learning\" highly.</mark> <mark>Similarly, if the text contains the phrase \"supervised classification\", then there would be an edge between \"supervised\" and \"classification\".</mark> <mark>If \"classification\" appears several other places and thus has many neighbors, its importance would contribute to the importance of \"supervised\".</mark> <mark>If it ends up with a high rank, it will be selected as one of the top T unigrams, along with \"learning\" and probably \"classification\".</mark> <mark>In the final post-processing step, we would then end up with keyphrases \"supervised learning\" and \"supervised classification\".</mark> <mark>In short, the co-occurrence graph will contain densely connected regions for terms that appear often and in different contexts.</mark> <mark>A random walk on this graph will have a stationary distribution that assigns large probabilities to the terms in the centers of the clusters.</mark> This is similar to densely connected Web pages getting ranked highly by PageRank. <mark>This approach has also been used in document summarization, considered below.</mark> <mark>Like keyphrase extraction, document summarization aims to identify the essence of a text.</mark> The only real difference is that now we are dealing with larger text units—whole sentences instead of words and phrases. Before getting into the details of some summarization methods, we will mention how summarization systems are typically evaluated. The most common way is using the so-called ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) measure. This is a recall-based measure that determines how well a system-generated summary covers the content present in one or more human-generated model summaries known as references. It is recall-based to encourage systems to include all the important topics in the text. Recall can be computed with respect to unigram, bigram, trigram, or 4-gram matching. For example, ROUGE-1 is computed as division of count of unigrams in reference that appear in system and count of unigrams in reference summary. If there are multiple references, the ROUGE-1 scores are averaged. <mark>Because ROUGE is based only on content overlap, it can determine if the same general concepts are discussed between an automatic summary and a reference summary, but it cannot determine if the result is coherent or the sentences flow together in a sensible manner.</mark> High-order n-gram ROUGE measures try to judge fluency to some degree. Note that ROUGE is similar to the BLEU measure for machine translation, but BLEU is precision- based, because translation systems favor accuracy. A promising line in document summarization is adaptive document/text summarization. [9] The idea of adaptive summarization involves preliminary recognition of document/text genre and subsequent application of summarization algorithms optimized for this genre. First summarizes that perform adaptive summarization have been created. <mark>[10]\n",

              "Supervised text summarization is very much like supervised keyphrase extraction.</mark> Basically, if you have a collection of documents and human-generated summaries for them, you can learn features of sentences that make them good candidates for inclusion in the summary. <mark>Features might include the position in the document (i.e., the first few sentences are probably important), the number of words in the sentence, etc.</mark> <mark>The main difficulty in supervised extractive summarization is that the known summaries must be manually created by extracting sentences so the sentences in an original training document can be labeled as \"in summary\" or \"not in summary\".</mark> This is not typically how people create summaries, so simply using journal abstracts or existing summaries is usually not sufficient. <mark>The sentences in these summaries do not necessarily match up with sentences in the original text, so it would be difficult to assign labels to examples for training.</mark> <mark>Note, however, that these natural summaries can still be used for evaluation purposes, since ROUGE-1 only cares about unigrams.</mark> <mark>During the DUC 2001 and 2002 evaluation workshops, TNO developed a sentence extraction system for multi-document summarization in the news domain.</mark> The system was based on a hybrid system using a naive Bayes classifier and statistical language models for modeling salience. Although the system exhibited good results, the researchers wanted to explore the effectiveness of a maximum entropy (ME) classifier for the meeting summarization task, as ME is known to be robust against feature dependencies. Maximum entropy has also been applied successfully for summarization in the broadcast news domain. The unsupervised approach to summarization is also quite similar in spirit to unsupervised keyphrase extraction and gets around the issue of costly training data. <mark>Some unsupervised summarization approaches are based on finding a \"centroid\" sentence, which is the mean word vector of all the sentences in the document.</mark> Then the sentences can be ranked with regard to their similarity to this centroid sentence. A more principled way to estimate sentence importance is using random walks and eigenvector centrality. <mark>LexRank[11] is an algorithm essentially identical to TextRank, and both use this approach for document summarization.</mark> <mark>The two methods were developed by different groups at the same time, and LexRank simply focused on summarization, but could just as easily be used for keyphrase extraction or any other NLP ranking task.</mark> In both LexRank and TextRank, a graph is constructed by creating a vertex for each sentence in the document. <mark>The edges between sentences are based on some form of semantic similarity or content overlap.</mark> <mark>While LexRank uses cosine similarity of TF-IDF vectors, TextRank uses a very similar measure based on the number of words two sentences have in common (normalized by the sentences' lengths).</mark> <mark>The LexRank paper explored using unweighted edges after applying a threshold to the cosine values, but also experimented with using edges with weights equal to the similarity score.</mark> TextRank uses continuous similarity scores as weights. <mark>In both algorithms, the sentences are ranked by applying PageRank to the resulting graph.</mark> <mark>A summary is formed by combining the top ranking sentences, using a threshold or length cutoff to limit the size of the summary.</mark> <mark>It is worth noting that TextRank was applied to summarization exactly as described here, while LexRank was used as part of a larger summarization system (MEAD) that combines the LexRank score (stationary probability) with other features like sentence position and length using a linear combination with either user-specified or automatically tuned weights.</mark> <mark>In this case, some training documents might be needed, though the TextRank results show the additional features are not absolutely necessary.</mark> <mark>Another important distinction is that TextRank was used for single document summarization, while LexRank has been applied to multi-document summarization.</mark> The task remains the same in both cases—only the number of sentences to choose from has grown. However, when summarizing multiple documents, there is a greater risk of selecting duplicate or highly redundant sentences to place in the same summary. <mark>Imagine you have a cluster of news articles on a particular event, and you want to produce one summary.</mark> <mark>Each article is likely to have many similar sentences, and you would only want to include distinct ideas in the summary.</mark> To address this issue, LexRank applies a heuristic post-processing step that builds up a summary by adding sentences in rank order, but discards any sentences that are too similar to ones already placed in the summary. The method used is called Cross-Sentence Information Subsumption (CSIS). <mark>These methods work based on the idea that sentences \"recommend\" other similar sentences to the reader.</mark> <mark>Thus, if one sentence is very similar to many others, it will likely be a sentence of great importance.</mark> The importance of this sentence also stems from the importance of the sentences \"recommending\" it. <mark>Thus, to get ranked highly and placed in a summary, a sentence must be similar to many sentences that are in turn also similar to many other sentences.</mark> This makes intuitive sense and allows the algorithms to be applied to any arbitrary new text. The methods are domain-independent and easily portable. <mark>One could imagine the features indicating important sentences in the news domain might vary considerably from the biomedical domain.</mark> However, the unsupervised \"recommendation\"-based approach applies to any domain. Multi-document summarization is an automatic procedure aimed at extraction of information from multiple texts written about the same topic. Resulting summary report allows individual users, such as professional information consumers, to quickly familiarize themselves with information contained in a large cluster of documents. In such a way, multi-document summarization systems are complementing the news aggregators performing the next step down the road of coping with information overload. Multi-document summarization may also be done in response to a question. [12] [4]\n",

(An absorbing random walk is like a standard random walk, except some states are now absorbing states that act as \"black holes\" that cause the walk to end abruptly at that state.) The algorithm is called GRASSHOPPER. <mark>[14] In addition to explicitly promoting diversity during the ranking process, GRASSHOPPER incorporates a prior ranking (based on sentence position in the case of summarization).</mark> <mark>The state of the art results for multi-document summarization, however, are obtained using mixtures of submodular functions.</mark> These methods have achieved the state of the art results for Document Summarization Corpora, DUC 04 - 07. <mark>[15] Similar results were also achieved with the use of determinantal point processes (which are a special case of submodular functions) for DUC-04.</mark> <mark>[16]\n",

Similarly, the facility location problem is a special case of submodular functions. <mark>The Facility Location function also naturally models coverage and diversity.</mark> <mark>Another example of a submodular optimization problem is using a determinantal point process to model diversity.</mark> Similarly, the Maximum-Marginal-Relevance procedure can also be seen as an instance of submodular optimization. All these important models encouraging coverage, diversity and information are all submodular. <mark>Moreover, submodular functions can be efficiently combined together, and the resulting function is still submodular.</mark> <mark>Hence, one could combine one submodular function which models diversity, another one which models coverage and use human supervision to learn a right model of a submodular function for the problem.</mark> While submodular functions are fitting problems for summarization, they also admit very efficient algorithms for optimization. For example, a simple greedy algorithm admits a constant factor guarantee. [17] Moreover, the greedy algorithm is extremely simple to implement and can scale to large datasets, which is very important for summarization problems. Submodular functions have achieved state-of-the-art for almost all summarization problems. For example, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2012[18] shows that submodular functions achieve the best results to date on DUC-04, DUC-05, DUC-06 and DUC-07 systems for document summarization. <mark>Similarly, work by Lin and Bilmes, 2011,[19] shows that many existing systems for automatic summarization are instances of submodular functions.</mark> This was a breakthrough result establishing submodular functions as the right models for summarization problems. <mark>[citation needed]\n",

Extrinsic evaluations, on the other hand, have tested the impact of summarization on tasks like relevance assessment, reading comprehension, etc. Intra-textual methods assess the output of a specific summarization system, and the inter-textual ones focus on contrastive analysis of outputs of several summarization systems. <mark>Human judgement often has wide variance on what is considered a \"good\" summary, which means that making the evaluation process automatic is particularly difficult.</mark> <mark>Manual evaluation can be used, but this is both time and labor-intensive as it requires humans to read not only the summaries but also the source documents.</mark> Other issues are those concerning coherence and coverage. <mark>One of the metrics used in NIST's annual Document Understanding Conferences, in which research groups submit their systems for both summarization and translation tasks, is the ROUGE metric (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation [2]).</mark> It essentially calculates n-gram overlaps between automatically generated summaries and previously-written human summaries.

Much effort has to be done in order to have corpus of texts and their corresponding summaries. Furthermore, for some methods, not only do we need to have human-made summaries available for comparison, but also manual annotation has to be performed in some of them (e.g. SCU in the Pyramid Method). In any case, what the evaluation methods need as an input, is a set of summaries to serve as gold standards and a set of automatic summaries. Moreover, they all perform a quantitative evaluation with regard to different similarity metrics. The first publication in the area dates back to 1958 (Lun), starting with a statistical technique. Research increased significantly in 2015. Term frequency–inverse document frequency had been used by 2016. Pattern-based summarization was the most powerful option for multi-document summarization found by 2016. In the following year it was surpassed by latent semantic analysis (LSA) combined with non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). <mark>Although they did not replace other approaches and are often combined with them, by 2019 machine learning methods dominated the extractive summarization of single documents, which was considered to be nearing maturity.</mark> By 2020 the field was still very active and research is shifting towards abstractive summation and real-time summarization.

It&#8217;s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon. It&#8217;s been funded by billions of dollars, and it&#8217;s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for\\xa0</span><span>NVIDIA</span><span>, in an interview with\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2021/05/usps-turns-ai-edge-boost-package-processing/173872/\"><i><span>Nextgov</span></i></a><span>.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0“And this is one of the few enterprise</span><span>&#8211;</span><span>wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post. (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to\\xa0</span><span>NVIDIA\\xa0</span><span>as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at\\xa0</span><span>NVIDIA\\xa0</span><span>and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia&#8217;s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS.

Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or\\xa0</span><span>PyTorch</span><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Multiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One model</span><span>,</span><span>\\xa0for example</span><span>,</span><span>\\xa0automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight</span><span>,</span><span>\\xa0and destination.

Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Accenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies</span><span>,</span><span>\\xa0and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of\\xa0</span><span>NVIDIA\\xa0</span><span>stated. Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers.\\xa0\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“</span><span>The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to\\xa0</span><i><span>Nextgov</span></i><span>. “And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year. In mid-December, during the last holiday season, the agency delivered as little as 62% of first-class mail on time—the lowest level in years, according to an account in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2021/05/06/how-ai-is-helping-nvidia-improve-u-s-postal-service-delivery/\"><span>VentureBeat</span></a><span>\\xa0.

Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/04/new-ai-regulations-are-coming-is-your-organization-ready\"><span>Harvard Business Review</span></a><span>.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>And on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/data-privacy-and-security/european-values-confront-ai-innovation-in-eus-proposed-ai-act/\"><i><span>AI Trends</span></i></a><span>, April 22, 2021)</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_20529\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20529\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-14AndrewBurt-2-1.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-20529\">Andrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai</figcaption></figure>\\n<p><span>While we don’t know\\xa0what these regulation will allow, “Three\\xa0</span><span>central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.bnh.ai/\"><span>bnh.ai</span></a><span>, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First,\\xa0</span><b><span>conduct assessments of AI risks</span></b><span>. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, Virginia’s recently-passed\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307\"><span>Consumer Data Protection Act</span></a><span>, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Second,\\xa0</span><b><span>accountability and independence</span></b><span>. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Third,\\xa0</span><b><span>continuous review</span></b><span>. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Approaches in US, Europe and China Differ</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/artificial-intelligence-regulatory-trends/\"><span>The Verdict</span></a><span>, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states.

Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>“So come her</span><span>e</span><span>—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines.

This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To accomplish this, he suggested,</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.</span><span>”</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Read the source articles and information\\xa0</span><span>in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/04/new-ai-regulations-are-coming-is-your-organization-ready\"><span>Harvard Business Review</span></a><span>, in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/artificial-intelligence-regulatory-trends/\"><span>The Verdict</span></a><span>\\xa0and in\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/\"><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span>.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>So, you ask for an explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Nowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Though that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Knowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Explanations come in all shapes and sizes.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Perhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to\\xa0</span><span>notice\\xa0</span><span>that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We usually take\\xa0</span><span>these differences\\xa0</span><span>for granted.\\xa0</span><span>Y</span><span>ou rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has</span><span>,\\xa0</span><span>in the case of a medical diagnosis</span><span>,</span><span>\\xa0whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Another twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We can add a twist on that twist.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Another angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas\\xa0</span><span>you</span><span>\\xa0are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why all this talk about explanations?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Because of AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Presumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Note that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Ergo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless.\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This is known as Explainable AI (XAI).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>XAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Take as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This means that the AI is\\xa0not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Amidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Those are the pittance explanations.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>And this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Of course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Shifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The question is this:\\xa0</span><i><span>In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?</span></i><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars</span></b><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And XAI</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>All occupants will be passengers</span><span>; t</span><span>he AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Now that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That’s perfectly fine.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Imagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I</span><span>t could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or\\xa0</span><span>facets</span><span>\\xa0about the explanation that was being provided.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Okay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>A self-driving car is taking you to your home.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Assume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Once the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>If there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened.

The car is suddenly brought to a halt. The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Well, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Humans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Presumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI. In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>At least until the day that AI does become sentient, then you can certainly ask away.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><i><span>Copyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0</span></i><i><span>\\xa0</span></i><a href=\"http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\"><i><span>http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website</span></i></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

It&#8217;s making data look uncannily realistic,&#8221; stated <a href=\"https://geography.washington.edu/people/bo-zhao\">Bo Zhao</a>, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075\">study</a>, in a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/04/21/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images/\">news release</a> from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075\"><em>Cartography and Geographic Information Science</em></a>. &#8220;The techniques are already there. We&#8217;re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,&#8221; Zhao stated.</p>\\n<p>Fake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.</p>\\n<p><strong>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm</strong></p>\\n<p>Now with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.</p>\\n<p>“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter\\xadconnected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/national-geospatial-intelligence-agency-challenged-to-keep-up-with-volatile-world/\">SpaceNews</a>.</p>\\n<p>To study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.</p>\\n<p>The researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.</p>\\n<p>Simulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.</p>\\n<p>The researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.</p>\\n<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403741/deepfake-geography-satellite-imagery-ai-generated-fakes-threat\">The Verge</a>, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.</p>\\n<p>“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.</p>\\n<p><strong>US Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection</strong></p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_20514\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20514\" height=\"267\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-7DrCCJayKuo-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-20514\">Professor C.-C.

Researchers at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory, in collaboration with Professor C.C. Jay Kuo&#8217;s research group at the University of Southern California, are examining the threat that deepfakes pose to our society and national security, according to a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/uarl-bat042921.php\">release </a>from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).</p>\\n<p>Their work is featured in the paper titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06929\">DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector,&#8221; </a>which will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2021 in July.</p>\\n<p>ARL researchers Dr. Suya You and Dr. Shuowen (Sean) Hu noted that most state-of-the-art deepfake video detection and media forensics methods are based upon deep learning, which has inherent weaknesses in robustness, scalability, and portability.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;Due to the progression of generative neural networks, AI-driven deepfakes have advanced so rapidly that there is a scarcity of reliable techniques to detect and defend against them,&#8221; You stated. &#8220;We have an urgent need for an alternative paradigm that can understand the mechanism behind the startling performance of deepfakes, and to develop effective defense solutions with solid theoretical support.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Relying on their experience with machine learning, signal analysis, and computer vision, the researchers developed a new theory and mathematical framework they call the Successive Subspace Learning, or SSL, as an innovative neural network architecture. SSL is the key innovation of DefakeHop, the researchers stated.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;SSL is an entirely new mathematical framework for neural network architecture developed from signal transform theory,&#8221; Kuo stated. &#8220;It is radically different from the traditional approach. It is very suitable for high-dimensional data that have short-, mid- and long-range covariance structures. SSL is a complete data-driven unsupervised framework, offering a brand-new tool for image processing and understanding tasks such as face biometrics.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Read the source articles and information in a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/04/21/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images/\">news release</a> from the University of Washington, in the journal <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075\"><em>Cartography and Geographic Information Science</em></a>,\\xa0 an account from <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/national-geospatial-intelligence-agency-challenged-to-keep-up-with-volatile-world/\">SpaceNews</a>,a <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-04/uarl-bat042921.php\">release </a>from the US Army Research Laboratory, and in the paper titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06929\">DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector.”</a></p>'}],\n",

The company recently announced it would be hiring 500 people in Calgary, Alberta, Canada over the next three years, which would double its Canadian workforce to 4,000 employees. “Calgary is a natural next step of our Canadian expansion. The city is home to a thriving talent pool. We will tap into this talent and offer skills and opportunities that will build on the city’s economic strengths,” stated Ravi Kumar, President of Infosys, in a <a href=\"https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2021/canadian-expansion-doubling-workforce2023.html\">press release</a>.</p>\\n<p>Over the last two years, Infosys has created 2,000 jobs across Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montreal. The Calgary expansion will enable Infosys to scale work with clients in Western Canada, Pacific Northwest, and the Central United States across various industries, including natural resources, energy, media, retail, and communications. The company will hire tech talent from fourteen educational institutions across the country, including the University of Calgary, University of Alberta, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Waterloo. Infosys also plans to hire 300 workers in Pennsylvania as part of its US hiring strategy, recruiting for a range of opportunities across technology and digital services, administration and operations.</p>\\n<p><strong>AI is Where the Money Is</strong></p>\\n<p>In an analysis of millions of job postings across the US, the labor market information provider Burning Glass wanted to see which professions had the highest percentage of job postings requesting AI skills, according to an account from <a href=\"https://insights.dice.com/2021/01/08/which-technology-jobs-will-require-a-i-and-machine-learning-skills/\">Dice</a>. Data science was requested by 22.4% of the postings, by far the highest. Next was data engineer at 5.5%, database architect at 4.6% and network engineer/architect at 3.1%.</p>\\n<p>Burning Glass sees machine learning as a “defining skill” among data scientists, needed for day-to-day work. Overall, jobs requiring AI skills are expected to grow 43.4% over the next decade. The current median salary for jobs heavily using AI skills is $105,000, good compared to many other professions.</p>\\n<p>Hiring managers will test for knowledge of fundamental concepts and ability to execute. A portfolio of AI-related projects can help a candidate’s prospects.</p>\\n<p>Burning Glass recently announced an expansion and update of its CyberSeek source of information on America’s cybersecurity workforce. “These updates are timely as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Strategic Plan aims to promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and multiple pathways to build and sustain a diverse and skilled workforce,” stated Rodney Petersen, Director of the NICE, in a Burning Glass <a href=\"https://www.burning-glass.com/cyberseek-strengthens-us-cybersecurity-workforce-new-data-resources-careers-credentials-employment-options/\">press release</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice\">NICE</a> is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused on supporting the country’s ability to address current and future cybersecurity education and workforce challenges.</p>\\n<p>Trends for AI in 2021 in the beginning of the latter stages of the global pandemic were highlighted in a recent account in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/28/ai-jobs-in-2021-here-are-some-key-trends/\">VentureBeat</a> as:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Hyperautomation,</strong> the application of AI and machine learning to augment workers and automate processes to a higher degree;</li>\\n<li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>, because consumers and employees expect companies to adopt AI in a responsible manner; companies will choose to do business with partners that commit to data ethics and data handling practices that reflect appropriate values;</li>\\n<li>And<strong> Workplace AI</strong>, to help with transitions to new models of work, especially with knowledge workers at home; AI will be used to augment customer services agents, to track employee health and for intelligent document extraction.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Read the source articles and information in <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/job-trend-analysis-marks-growth-of-data-science-ai-roles/\">TechRepublic</a>, in a <a href=\"https://www.novacoast.com/novacoast-named-top-mssp/\">press release</a> from Novacoast, in<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/pendo-ceo-todd-olson-turns-pandemic-possibilities-reinvents-digital-communication-businesses-1574558\"> Newsweek</a>, in a <a href=\"https://www.infosys.com/newsroom/press-releases/2021/canadian-expansion-doubling-workforce2023.html\">press release</a> from Infosys, in an account from <a href=\"https://insights.dice.com/2021/01/08/which-technology-jobs-will-require-a-i-and-machine-learning-skills/\">Dice</a>, in a Burning Glass <a href=\"https://www.burning-glass.com/cyberseek-strengthens-us-cybersecurity-workforce-new-data-resources-careers-credentials-employment-options/\">press release</a> and in an account in <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/12/28/ai-jobs-in-2021-here-are-some-key-trends/\">VentureBeat</a>.</p>'}],\n",

Using NVIDIA&#8217;s Jetson Nano device, for example, CDM Smith is able to train an AI computer vision model to detect wrong-way drivers, he stated. The technology use case combines capabilities of sensors with the computing power of AI.</p>\\n<p>&#8220;You have someone sitting in a command center trying to monitor 300 screens,&#8221; stated Neitz, speaking on the panel. &#8220;Why rely on a human to be observant and alert?&#8221; Instead, the company relies on a mix of sensors and algorithms to monitor and track when drivers are using lanes in an erratic way, or how traffic is behaving around a construction zone.</p>\\n<p>Another application finds CDM Smith combining IoT soil sensors, data analytics and weather information to predict when a potential landslide could impact a railroad track.</p>\\n<p><strong>Pandemic Has Accelerated the Move to Cloud Computing</strong></p>\\n<p>The pandemic seems to have accelerated the move to cloud computing. A recent survey of 750 cloud decision-makers found that 92% of represented enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 90% have a hybrid cloud strategy. The results are contained in the <a href=\"https://info.flexera.com/CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud?lead_source=Website%20Visitor&amp;id=Flexera.com-PR\">2021 State of the Cloud Report</a> from Flexera, an IT asset management software company.</p>\\n<figure class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" id=\"attachment_20506\" style=\"width: 200px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"size-full wp-image-20506\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://www.aitrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5-7JimRyan-2.jpeg\" width=\"200\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\" id=\"caption-attachment-20506\">Jim Ryan, President and CEO, Flexera</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>“COVID-19 has accelerated the migration to cloud computing,” stated Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Flexera, in a <a href=\"https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2021-state-of-the-cloud-report.html\">press release</a>. “Still, cloud isn’t magic or the land of milk and honey. Companies are moving fast, facing challenges, and trying to connect cloud computing to business outcomes. The appetite for digital transformation is high, but real-world challenges—such as managing security and optimizing cloud spend—still must be addressed.”</p>\\n<p>Cloud adoption among the respondents was as follows: AWS adoption grew to 77% (from 76% last year); Azure grew to 73% (from 63% last year); Google Cloud grew to 47% (from 35% last year); VMware Cloud on AWS grew to 24% (from 17% last year); Oracle Infrastructure Cloud grew to 29% (from 17% last year); IBM Public Cloud grew to 24% (from 13% last year); and Alibaba Cloud grew to 12% (from 7% last year).</p>\\n<p>The key considerations CIOs are advised to take into account as they gravitate more of their IT operations to the cloud touch on infrastructure, processes and culture, advised a recent account in<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunoaziza/2021/04/30/5-things-cios-need-to-consider-when-moving-to-the-cloud/?sh=3ebe321f7f0c\"> Forbes</a>. They include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Putting Customers and Employees First</strong>. In the past year, organizations have transformed and served customers in new ways. Restaurants, for example, had to enable better ordering of food online to be picked up or delivered and paid for electronically. CIOs have transitioned from being “enablers” of digital transformation to being “drivers” of business change. The trend is seen as so produced that Gartner predicts that 25% of large-enterprise CIOs could become “COO by proxy” by 2024.</li>\\n<li><strong>Developing ‘Enterprise Agility.’</strong> Each company needs to determine its own path to competitive advantage, as in which approach to take for the digital and data journey, whether to emulate the infrastructure choices of digital native competitors or invent a new way as the company looks for a unique enterprise identity.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>IT Shifts Within Scaled, Agile Organizations</strong></p>\\n<p>Research from McKinsey &amp; Co. on enterprise agility identifies five core IT shifts within scaled agile organizations. These include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Speed</strong>. Information needs to be relevant, actionable &amp; timely, whether for real-time scenarios such as fraud detection that triggers machine intervention, or monitoring that requires human judgment, “The notion of speed and pace is key,” stated the author of the <em>Forbes</em> account, Bruno Aziza, a technology entrepreneur who is the current Head of Data &amp; Analytics for Google Cloud.</li>\\n<li><strong>Scale</strong>. The world is predicted to store 200 zettabytes [a zettabyte is 10 to the power of 21] of data by 2025, and 50% of all data will be in the cloud. “The question is: are your teams building for a world where capacity could be limitless? Or are they living in a world where only some data deserves to be stored?” Aziza queried. He suggests that team members look at more data; they don’t know which data will become more valuable over time.</li>\\n<li><strong>Security</strong>. The number one concern of companies of all sizes in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report, is security. The higher the company’s cloud maturity, the higher the concern. In a world where more data comes from a range of sources and is used by more people across more use cases, security and data governance needs to be taken into account on day one, the author suggested.</li>\\n<li><strong>Human Intelligence</strong>. AI is important to digital transformation efforts; the AI Specialist is now one of the fastest growing jobs on LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report. Many organizations are looking to infuse AI to optimize their technical infrastructure and focus on the adoption of machine learning as part of intelligent application initiatives. “But many struggle to marry human intelligence with machine intelligence,” the author states. The best guidance he has found so far on when humans are better equipped than machines, is from the book <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Only-Humans-Need-Apply-Machines/dp/0062438611\">Only Humans Need Apply</a></em> by Tom Davenport, released in 2016.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Aziza recommends working to identify the use cases where machine intelligence is most appropriate and the ones where humans do a better job “augmenting” the machine’s capabilities.</p>\\n<p>Read the source articles and information from sessions of the <a href=\"https://mitcio.com/\">2021 MIT CIO Symposium</a>, in <a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/emerging-tech-use-cases-MIT-CIO/599369/\">CIO Dive</a>, in a <a href=\"https://www.flexera.com/about-us/press-center/flexera-releases-2021-state-of-the-cloud-report.html\">press release</a> from Flexera, in<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunoaziza/2021/04/30/5-things-cios-need-to-consider-when-moving-to-the-cloud/?sh=3ebe321f7f0c\"> Forbes</a> and from the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Only-Humans-Need-Apply-Machines/dp/0062438611\"><em>Only Humans Need Apply</em></a> by Tom Davenport.</p>'}],\n",

Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0</span><span>is\\xa0</span><span>unlawfully park</span><span>ed</span><span>\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0</span><span>m</span><span>aking your turn</span><span>,\\xa0</span><span>and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Your mind races as you\\xa0</span><span>consider\\xa0</span><span>your options.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following you</span><span>r\\xa0</span><span>turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0</span><span>But</span><span>\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Sadly, n</span><span>either\\xa0</span><span>option\\xa0</span><span>is\\xa0</span><span>satisfactory.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Driving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>What could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0</span><i><span>not</span></i><span>\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Voila</span><span>:\\xa0</span><span>the bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Imagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene</span><span>.</span><span>\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Rather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>There are some potential downsides.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at on</span><span>c</span><span>e. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0</span><span>thing</span><span>\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0</span><span>take in extra information</span><span>. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Even if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability.

The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>All occupants will be passengers</span><span>; t</span><span>he AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Th</span><span>e AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this</span><span>\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Via a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Okay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That’s bound to create difficulties.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s something else to ponder.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0</span><span>imagined</span><span>. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’ll throw you another curveball.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0</span><span>viably</span><span>\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Without seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (</span><span>i</span><span>.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We can add more icing to that cake.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Various experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0</span><span>sensory</span><span>\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is</span><span>\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0</span><span>at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Per an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Bryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Expect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Overall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I mention that this should be considered an\\xa0</span><i><span>add-on</span></i><span>\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There are other twists and turns to be considered.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24&#215;7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0</span><span>as including perhaps</span><span>\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One last quick point for the moment on this topi</span><span>c:\\xa0</span><span>There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird&#8217;s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Similarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Speaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Maybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><i><span>Copyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0</span></i><i><span>\\xa0</span></i><a href=\"http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\"><i><span>http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website</span></i></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>'}],\n",

Desmond, AI Trends Editor</span></i><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Predictive maintenance (</span><span>PdM</span><span>) has emerged as a killer AI app.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.</span><span> </span><span>These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>These observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany. Not much was happening. “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in </span><a href=\"https://iotbusinessnews.com/2021/05/06/85410-predictive-maintenance-market-the-evolution-from-niche-topic-to-high-roi-application/\"><span>IoT Business News</span></a><span>. “Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Things have changed. IoT Analytics analyst </span><span>Fernando Alberto Brügge stated, </span><span>“</span><span>Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach. It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Technical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Along with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions. IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB</span><span>,</span><span> and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear. In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83</span><span>%</span><span> of the cases. Some 45</span><span>%</span><span> of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year. “This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>More IoT Sensors Means More Precision</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Implemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers. As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Many projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data. AspenTech and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches. AspenTech has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>More predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance  management systems (CMMS). Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Reduced Downtime Results in Savings</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Gains come from preventing downtime. </span><span>“</span><span>Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,&#8221; stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from</span><span> </span><a href=\"https://searcherp.techtarget.com/feature/Predictive-maintenance-Definition-benefits-example-strategy\"><span>TechTarget</span></a><span>.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Advances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way.</span><span> &#8220;Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,&#8221; stated Parages.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>As a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. “Predictive maintenance &#8220;is a very powerful weapon,&#8221; he stated.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10</span><span>%</span><span> of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“</span><span>They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks</span><span>—that </span><span>means better customer service and happier customers,&#8221; Miller stated. He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility. Atos, Dassault Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“The federal government has been for the last several years talking about the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategic imperative to our nation, and as an important funding priority. It&#8217;s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon. It&#8217;s been funded by billions of dollars, and it&#8217;s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for </span><span>NVIDIA</span><span>, in an interview with </span><a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/2021/05/usps-turns-ai-edge-boost-package-processing/173872/\"><i><span>Nextgov</span></i></a><span>. </span><span> “And this is one of the few enterprise</span><span>&#8211;</span><span>wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post. (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to </span><span>NVIDIA </span><span>as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at </span><span>NVIDIA </span><span>and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia&#8217;s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>USPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow. “In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Today, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by </span><span>NVIDIA </span><span>Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software. Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or </span><span>PyTorch</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Multiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Accenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies</span><span>,</span><span> and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of </span><span>NVIDIA </span><span>stated. Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers.  </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“</span><span>The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to </span><i><span>Nextgov</span></i><span>. “And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year.

            "<p><span>While we don’t know what these regulation will allow, “Three </span><span>central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of </span><a href=\"https://www.bnh.ai/\"><span>bnh.ai</span></a><span>, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>First, </span><b><span>conduct assessments of AI risks</span></b><span>. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, Virginia’s recently-passed </span><a href=\"https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+sum+HB2307\"><span>Consumer Data Protection Act</span></a><span>, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.</span><span> </span><span>The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Second, </span><b><span>accountability and independence</span></b><span>. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Third, </span><b><span>continuous review</span></b><span>. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Approaches in US, Europe and China Differ</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in </span><a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/artificial-intelligence-regulatory-trends/\"><span>The Verdict</span></a><span>, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens. The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“</span><span>Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a</span><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/risk-regulatory/library/top-policy-trends/ai.html\"><span> recent report </span></a><span>from pwc, the multinational professional services firm. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“</span><span>It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the pwc analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>Critics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>While some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act leaves too much gray area, t</span><span>he hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in </span><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake/\"><span>TechCrunch</span></a><span>. AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“So come her</span><span>e</span><span>—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Reactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London. “The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.” </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>To accomplish this, he suggested,</span><span> </span><span>“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.</span><span>”</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Cyberattacks and identity fraud losses increased dramatically in 2020 as the pandemic made remote work the norm, setting the stage for AI and biometrics to combine in efforts to attain a higher level of protection.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One study found banks worldwide saw a 238% jump in cyberattacks between February and April 2020; a study from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research found that identity fraud losses grew to $56 billion last year as fraudsters used stolen personal information to create synthetic identities, according to a recent account from </span><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/identity/2021/stash-banks-on-biometrics-machine-learning-to-support-digital-first-id-verification/\"><span>Pymnts.com</span></a><span>. In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Companies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with </span><span>Pymnts</span><span>.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>SIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity</span></b><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on </span><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/how-to/sim-swap-fraud-how-to-prevent-your-phone-number-from-being-stolen/\"><span>CNET.</span></a><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Once your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Identity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated. “To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Asked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Going forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><b><span>AI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages</span></b><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>AI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/06/guard-digital-identity-with-artificial-intelligence/?sh=3fdeceaa6bca\"><span>Forbes</span></a><span>.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

AI systems are entirely likely to end the reign of the individual hacker.”</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>While he sees AI authentication as being in an early phase, Gupta recommended that companies examine the following: the use of intelligent adaptive authentication, such as local and device fingerprint; biometric authentication, based on the face or fingerprints; and smart data filters. “A well-developed AI protection system will have the ability to respond in nanoseconds to close a leak,” he stated.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>The global pandemic has had a dramatic impact on consumer financial behavior. Consumers spent more time at home in 2020, transacted less than in previous years, and relied heavily on streaming services, digital commerce, and payments. They also corresponded more via email and text, for both work and personal life.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“The pandemic inspired a major shift in how criminals approach fraud,” stated </span><a href=\"https://www.javelinstrategy.com/member/john-buzzard\"><span>John Buzzard</span></a><span>, Lead Analyst, Fraud &amp; Security, with Javelin Strategy &amp; Research in a </span><a href=\"https://www.javelinstrategy.com/press-release/total-identity-fraud-losses-soar-56-billion-2020\"><span>press release. </span></a><span>“Identity fraud has evolved and now reflects the lengths criminals will take to directly target consumers in order to steal their personally identifiable information.”</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Companies made quick adjustments to their business models, such as by increasing remote interactions with borrowers for loan originations and closings, and criminals pounced on new vulnerabilities they discovered. </span><span>Nearly one-third of identity fraud victims say their financial services providers did not satisfactorily resolve their problems, and 38% of victims closed their accounts because of lack of resolution, the Javelin researchers found. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>“It is clear that financial institutions must continue to proactively and transparently manage fraud as a means to deepen their customer relationships,” stated Eric Kraus, Vice President and General Manager of Fraud, Risk and Compliance, FIS. The company offers technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms globally. “Through our continuing business relationships with financial institutions, we know firsthand that consumers are looking to their banks to resolve instances of fraud, regardless of how the fraud occurred,” he added.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Our lives are filled with explanations.</span><span> </span><span>You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>So, you ask for an explanation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Nowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Though that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Knowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Explanations come in all shapes and sizes.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Perhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to </span><span>notice </span><span>that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>We usually take </span><span>these differences </span><span>for granted. </span><span>Y</span><span>ou rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has</span><span>, </span><span>in the case of a medical diagnosis</span><span>,</span><span> whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>All told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>We can add a twist on that twist.</span><span> </span><span>Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.</span><span> </span><span>Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Another angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas </span><span>you</span><span> are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Why all this talk about explanations?</span><span> </span><span>Because of AI.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Presumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Note that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Ergo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless. </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This is known as Explainable AI (XAI).</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>XAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Take as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This means that the AI is not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Amidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Those are the pittance explanations.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>And this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Of course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Shifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Now that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>First, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>We can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That’s perfectly fine.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Imagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>I</span><span>t could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or </span><span>facets</span><span> about the explanation that was being provided.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Okay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.</span><span> </span><span>A self-driving car is taking you to your home.</span><span> </span><span>The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Assume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Once the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>If there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened. The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Well, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Humans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Presumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI.

            "<p>Deepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.</p>\n",
            "<p>Deepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat. Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.</p>\n",

            "<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t just Photoshopping things. It&#8217;s making data look uncannily realistic,&#8221; stated <a href=\"https://geography.washington.edu/people/bo-zhao\">Bo Zhao</a>, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075\">study</a>, in a <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/04/21/a-growing-problem-of-deepfake-geography-how-ai-falsifies-satellite-images/\">news release</a> from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1910075\"><em>Cartography and Geographic Information Science</em></a>. &#8220;The techniques are already there. We&#8217;re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,&#8221; Zhao stated.</p>\n",
            "<p>Fake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.</p>\n",
            "<p><strong>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm</strong></p>\n",
            "<p>Now with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.</p>\n",
            "<p>“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter­connected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/national-geospatial-intelligence-agency-challenged-to-keep-up-with-volatile-world/\">SpaceNews</a>.</p>\n",
            "<p>To study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.</p>\n",
            "<p>The researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.</p>\n",
            "<p>Simulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.</p>\n",
            "<p>The researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.</p>\n",
            "<p>In an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403741/deepfake-geography-satellite-imagery-ai-generated-fakes-threat\">The Verge</a>, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.</p>\n",
            "<p>“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.</p>\n",

            "<p><span>When driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene. </span><span>Let’s explore why. </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Imagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area. </span><span>There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that </span><span>is </span><span>unlawfully park</span><span>ed</span><span> in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until </span><span>m</span><span>aking your turn</span><span>, </span><span>and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Your mind races as you </span><span>consider </span><span>your options.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following you</span><span>r </span><span>turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car. </span><span>But</span><span> other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Sadly, n</span><span>either </span><span>option </span><span>is </span><span>satisfactory.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>All it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Driving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.</span><span> </span><span>It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>What could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to </span><i><span>not</span></i><span> make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Voila</span><span>: </span><span>the bird’s-eye view.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Imagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene</span><span>.</span><span> Now that’s some kind of driving.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Rather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>As such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a wiser choice with this added vantage point.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.</span><span> </span><span>There are some potential downsides.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>A human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at on</span><span>c</span><span>e. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at </span><span>thing</span><span> at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The question arises as to how a human driver can </span><span>take in extra information</span><span>. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Even if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Some people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Shifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.</span><span> </span><span>Here is an intriguing question: </span><i><span>Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?</span></i><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Why this</span><span> added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span> </span><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI.

In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>First, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Via a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Okay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.</span><span> </span><span>We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That’s bound to create difficulties.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>In that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Here’s something else to ponder.</span><span> </span><span>Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.</span><span> </span><span>This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>This seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be </span><span>imagined</span><span>. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>I’ll throw you another curveball.</span><span> </span><span>Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>On the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer </span><span>viably</span><span> accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Without seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>That being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide attention to one thing at a time (</span><span>i</span><span>.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>We can add more icing to that cake.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>It is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>All told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Various experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view </span><span>sensory</span><span> set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is</span><span> a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars </span><span>at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Per an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Bryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",

            "<p><span>Overall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>I mention that this should be considered an </span><i><span>add-on</span></i><span> since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>There are other twists and turns to be considered.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24&#215;7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such </span><span>as including perhaps</span><span> radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>One last quick point for the moment on this topi</span><span>c: </span><span>There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>For example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird&#8217;s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>All of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>The other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?</span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Suppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Similarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Speaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>Maybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n",
            "<p><span>You could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.</span><span> </span></p>\n",

In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0</span><span>is\\xa0</span><span>unlawfully park</span><span>ed</span><span>\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0</span><span>m</span><span>aking your turn</span><span>,\\xa0</span><span>and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Your mind races as you\\xa0</span><span>consider\\xa0</span><span>your options.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following you</span><span>r\\xa0</span><span>turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0</span><span>But</span><span>\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Sadly, n</span><span>either\\xa0</span><span>option\\xa0</span><span>is\\xa0</span><span>satisfactory.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Driving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>What could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0</span><i><span>not</span></i><span>\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Voila</span><span>:\\xa0</span><span>the bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Imagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene</span><span>.</span><span>\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Rather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>There are some potential downsides.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>A human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at on</span><span>c</span><span>e. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0</span><span>thing</span><span>\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0</span><span>take in extra information</span><span>. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Even if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Some people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Shifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0</span><i><span>Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?</span></i><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s unpack the matter and see.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Understanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>To be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0</span><a href=\"http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\"><span>http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Be aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0</span><a href=\"https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\"><span>https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/</span></a><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><b><span>Self-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View</span></b><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>All occupants will be passengers</span><span>; t</span><span>he AI is doing the driving.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Th</span><span>e AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Why this</span><span>\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Let’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>First, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Via a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Okay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That’s bound to create difficulties.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>In that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Here’s something else to ponder.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>You might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>This seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0</span><span>imagined</span><span>. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>I’ll throw you another curveball.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>On the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0</span><span>viably</span><span>\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Without seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>That being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (</span><span>i</span><span>.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>We can add more icing to that cake.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>It is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Various experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0</span><span>sensory</span><span>\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is</span><span>\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0</span><span>at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities.

This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>There are other twists and turns to be considered.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24&#215;7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0</span><span>as including perhaps</span><span>\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>One last quick point for the moment on this topi</span><span>c:\\xa0</span><span>There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>For example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird&#8217;s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>All of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>The other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Suppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span><span>\\xa0</span></p>\\n<p><span>Similarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts.

              "'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.\\xa0Let’s explore why.\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area.\\xa0There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0is\\xa0unlawfully parked\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0making your turn,\\xa0and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYour mind races as you\\xa0consider\\xa0your options.\\xa0\\nYou could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your\\xa0turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0But\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.\\xa0\\nSadly, neither\\xa0option\\xa0is\\xa0satisfactory.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDriving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.\\xa0It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?\\xa0\\nYou might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0not\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoila:\\xa0the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene.\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.\\xa0\\nRather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.\\xa0There are some potential downsides.\\xa0\\nA human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0thing\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0take in extra information. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?\\xa0\\nLet’s unpack the matter and see.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nThe AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVia a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.\\xa0\\nThat’s bound to create difficulties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s something else to ponder.\\xa0Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.\\xa0This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0imagined. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’ll throw you another curveball.\\xa0Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?\\xa0\\nOn the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0viably\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.\\xa0\\nWithout seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can add more icing to that cake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.\\xa0\\nAll told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.\\xa0\\nVarious experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.\\xa0\\nFor example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0sensory\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI mention that this should be considered an\\xa0add-on\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.\\xa0\\nThere are other twists and turns to be considered.\\xa0\\nFor example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).\\xa0\\nThe key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0as including perhaps\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne last quick point for the moment on this topic:\\xa0There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.\\xa0\\nAll of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?\\xa0\\nSuppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSimilarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0'"

Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nPredictive maintenance (PdM)\\xa0has emerged as a killer AI app.\\xa0\\nIn the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.\\xa0These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.\\xa0\\nThese observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany. Not much was happening. “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in\\xa0IoT Business News. “Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings have changed. IoT Analytics analyst\\xa0Fernando Alberto\\xa0Brügge\\xa0stated,\\xa0“Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach. It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.”\\xa0\\nTechnical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlong with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions. IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB,\\xa0and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear. In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83%\\xa0of the cases. Some 45%\\xa0of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year. “This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore IoT Sensors Means More Precision\\xa0\\nImplemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers. As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMany projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy.\\xa0\\nThe move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing.\\xa0\\nMore predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance\\xa0 management systems (CMMS). Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReduced Downtime Results in Savings\\xa0\\nGains come from preventing downtime.\\xa0“Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,” stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from\\xa0TechTarget.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFelipe Parages, Senior Data Scientist, Valkyrie\\nAdvances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.\\xa0\\nIt used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way.\\xa0“Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,” stated Parages.\\xa0\\nAs a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. “Predictive maintenance “is a very powerful weapon,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10%\\xa0of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks—that\\xa0means better customer service and happier customers,” Miller stated. He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project.\\xa0\\nIn an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility. Atos, Dassault\\xa0Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, Groupe Renault\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Renault, stated in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics,\\xa0“In the new mobility value chain, on-board intelligence systems are the new driving force, where all research and investment are now concentrated. Faced with this technological challenge, we are choosing to play collectively and openly. There will be no center of gravity, the value of each will be multiplied by others. The combined expertise in cybersecurity, microelectronics, energy and data management will enable us to develop unique, cutting-edge solutions for low-carbon, shared, and responsible mobility, made in Europe.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Software République will be based in Guyancourt, a commune in north-central France at the Renault\\xa0Technocentre\\xa0in a building called\\xa0Odyssée, a 12,000 square meter space which is eco-responsible. For example, its interior and exterior structure is 100 percent wood, and the building is covered with photovoltaic panels.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles in\\xa0IoT Business News,\\xa0\\xa0TechTarget, and\\xa0in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics.',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Editor John P. Desmond\\xa0\\xa0\\nNVIDIA\\xa0on May 6 detailed a partnership with the US Postal Service underway for over a year to speed up mail service using AI, with a goal of reducing current processing time tasks that take days to hours.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project fields edge servers at 195 Post Services sites across the nation, which review 20 terabytes of images a day from 1,000 mail processing machines, according to a post on the\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0blog.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal, Nvidia\\n“The federal government has been for the last several years talking about the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategic imperative to our nation, and as an important funding priority. It’s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon. It’s been funded by billions of dollars, and it’s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for\\xa0NVIDIA, in an interview with\\xa0Nextgov.\\xa0\\xa0“And this is one of the few enterprise–wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post. (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia’s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.\\xa0\\n“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS. He oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses\\xa0NVIDIA-Certified\\xa0edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another analysis, a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nContract Awarded in 2019 for System Using OCR\\xa0\\xa0\\nUSPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow. “In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.\\xa0\\nAI algorithms were developed on these NVIDIA DGX servers at a US Postal Service Engineering facility. (Credit: Nvidia)\\nToday, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software. Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or\\xa0PyTorch.\\xa0\\nThe deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added\\xa0\\nMultiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.\\xa0\\n“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne model,\\xa0for example,\\xa0automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight,\\xa0and destination. Another one that will automatically decipher a damaged barcode could be online this summer.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated.\\xa0\\nAccenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies,\\xa0and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0stated. Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to\\xa0Nextgov. “And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.”\\xa0\\nThe new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year. In mid-December, during the last holiday season, the agency delivered as little as 62% of first-class mail on time—the lowest level in years, according to an account in\\xa0VentureBeat\\xa0. The rate rebounded to 84% by the week of March 6 but remained below the agency’s target of about 96%.\\xa0\\nThe Postal Service has blamed the pandemic and record peak periods for much of the poor service performance.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0on the\\xa0Nvidia blog, in\\xa0Nextgov\\xa0and\\xa0in\\xa0VentureBeat.',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\nNew laws will soon shape how companies use AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe five largest federal financial regulators in the US recently released a request for information how banks use AI, signaling that new guidance is coming for the finance business. Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in\\xa0Harvard Business Review.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See\\xa0AI Trends, April 22, 2021)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAndrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai\\nWhile we don’t know\\xa0what these regulation will allow, “Three\\xa0central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of\\xa0bnh.ai, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst,\\xa0conduct assessments of AI risks. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, Virginia’s recently-passed\\xa0Consumer Data Protection Act, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.\\xa0\\nThe EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.\\xa0The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSecond,\\xa0accountability and independence. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThird,\\xa0continuous review. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproaches in US, Europe and China Differ\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in\\xa0The Verdict, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.\\xa0\\n“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens. The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19.\\xa0\\n“Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.\\xa0\\nIn the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a\\xa0recent report\\xa0from\\xa0pwc, the multinational professional services firm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the\\xa0pwc\\xa0analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCritics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area\\xa0\\nWhile some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act\\xa0leaves too much gray area, the hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market\\n“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in\\xa0TechCrunch. AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.”\\xa0\\n“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”\\xa0\\n“So come here—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested.\\xa0\\nAnother reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.\\xa0\\nReactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.\\xa0\\n“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London. “The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo accomplish this, he suggested,\\xa0“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0in\\xa0Harvard Business Review, in\\xa0The Verdict\\xa0and in\\xa0TechCrunch.\\xa0',\n",

In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompanies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.\\xa0\\nCaleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud, Stash Financial\\n“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with\\xa0Pymnts.\\xa0\\nSIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on\\xa0CNET.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIdentity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated.\\xa0“To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGoing forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.\\xa0\\nAI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages\\xa0\\nAI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in\\xa0Forbes.\\xa0\\nDeepak Gupta, Cofounder and CTO,\\xa0LoginRadius\\n“AI has the power to save the world from digital identity fraud,” stated Deepak Gupta, author of the Forbes article and\\xa0cofounder\\xa0and CTO of\\xa0LoginRadius, a cloud-based consumer identity platform. “In the fight against ID theft, it is already a strong weapon. AI systems are entirely likely to end the reign of the individual hacker.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile he sees AI authentication as being in an early phase, Gupta recommended that companies examine the following: the use of intelligent adaptive authentication, such as local and device fingerprint; biometric authentication, based on the face or fingerprints; and smart data filters. “A well-developed AI protection system will have the ability to respond in nanoseconds to close a leak,” he stated.\\xa0\\nPandemic Altered Consumer Financial Behavior, Spurred Identity Fraud\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe global pandemic has had a dramatic impact on consumer financial behavior. Consumers spent more time at home in 2020, transacted less than in previous years, and relied heavily on streaming services, digital commerce, and payments. They also corresponded more via email and text, for both work and personal life.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The pandemic inspired a major shift in how criminals approach fraud,” stated\\xa0John Buzzard, Lead Analyst, Fraud & Security, with Javelin Strategy & Research in a\\xa0press release.\\xa0“Identity fraud has evolved and now reflects the lengths criminals will take to directly target consumers in order to steal their personally identifiable information.”\\xa0\\nCompanies made quick adjustments to their business models, such as by increasing remote interactions with borrowers for loan originations and closings, and criminals pounced on new vulnerabilities they discovered.\\xa0Nearly one-third of identity fraud victims say their financial services providers did not satisfactorily resolve their problems, and 38% of victims closed their accounts because of lack of resolution, the Javelin researchers found.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It is clear that financial institutions must continue to proactively and transparently manage fraud as a means to deepen their customer relationships,” stated Eric Kraus, Vice President and General Manager of Fraud, Risk and Compliance, FIS. The company offers technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms globally. “Through our continuing business relationships with financial institutions, we know firsthand that consumers are looking to their banks to resolve instances of fraud, regardless of how the fraud occurred,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis push from consumers who are becoming increasingly savvy online will lay a foundation for safer digital transactions.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Static forms of consumer authentication must be replaced with a modern, standards-based approach that utilizes biometrics,” stated David\\xa0Henstock, Vice President of Identity Products at Visa, the world’s leader in digital payments. “Businesses benefit from reduced customer friction, lower abandonment rates and fewer chargebacks, while consumers benefit from better fraud prevention and faster payment during checkout.”\\xa0\\nThe\\xa02021 Identity Fraud Study\\xa0from Javelin is now in its 18th year.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0from\\xa0Pymnts.com, from\\xa0CNET,\\xa0in\\xa0Forbes\\xa0and in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from\\xa0Javelin Strategy & Research.\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur lives are filled with explanations.\\xa0You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.\\xa0\\nSo, you ask for an explanation.\\xa0\\nIn a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThough that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.\\xa0\\nKnowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.\\xa0\\nExplanations come in all shapes and sizes.\\xa0\\nA person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.\\xa0\\nThe explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.\\xa0\\nPerhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.\\xa0\\nThe person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to\\xa0notice\\xa0that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe usually take\\xa0these differences\\xa0for granted.\\xa0You rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has,\\xa0in the case of a medical diagnosis,\\xa0whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.\\xa0\\nAll told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.\\xa0\\nWe can add a twist on that twist.\\xa0Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.\\xa0Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.\\xa0\\nThat’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.\\xa0\\nAnother angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas\\xa0you\\xa0are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy all this talk about explanations?\\xa0Because of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNote that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.\\xa0\\nErgo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is known as Explainable AI (XAI).\\xa0\\nXAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTake as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.\\xa0\\nThis means that the AI is\\xa0not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.\\xa0\\nSome assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.\\xa0\\nThose are the pittance explanations.\\xa0\\nA more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOf course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question is this:\\xa0In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?\\xa0\\nLet’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And XAI\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s perfectly fine.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.\\xa0\\nIt could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.\\xa0\\nYou might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or\\xa0facets\\xa0about the explanation that was being provided.\\xa0\\nOkay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.\\xa0A self-driving car is taking you to your home.\\xa0The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.\\xa0\\nIn essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.\\xa0\\nYou would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.\\xa0\\nThe point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened. The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are lots and lots of situations that can arise when riding in a car and for which you might desire an explanation. The car is suddenly brought to a halt. The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWell, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.\\xa0\\nHumans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI. In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question.\\xa0\\nThe one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt least until the day that AI does become sentient, then you can certainly ask away.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\nDeepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.\\nDeepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat. Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.\\nBo Zhao, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Washington\\n“This isn’t just Photoshopping things. It’s making data look uncannily realistic,” stated Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the study, in a news release from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. “The techniques are already there. We’re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,” Zhao stated.\\nFake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.\\nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm\\nNow with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.\\n“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter\\xadconnected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from SpaceNews.\\nTo study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.\\nThe researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.\\nSimulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.\\nThe researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.\\nIn an interview with The Verge, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.\\n“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.\\nUS Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection\\nProfessor C.-C. Jay Kuo, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California\\nUS Army researchers are also working on a deepfake detection method. Researchers at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory, in collaboration with Professor C.C. Jay Kuo’s research group at the University of Southern California, are examining the threat that deepfakes pose to our society and national security, according to a release from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).\\nTheir work is featured in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector,” which will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2021 in July.\\nARL researchers Dr. Suya You and Dr. Shuowen (Sean) Hu noted that most state-of-the-art deepfake video detection and media forensics methods are based upon deep learning, which has inherent weaknesses in robustness, scalability, and portability.\\n“Due to the progression of generative neural networks, AI-driven deepfakes have advanced so rapidly that there is a scarcity of reliable techniques to detect and defend against them,” You stated. “We have an urgent need for an alternative paradigm that can understand the mechanism behind the startling performance of deepfakes, and to develop effective defense solutions with solid theoretical support.”\\nRelying on their experience with machine learning, signal analysis, and computer vision, the researchers developed a new theory and mathematical framework they call the Successive Subspace Learning, or SSL, as an innovative neural network architecture. SSL is the key innovation of DefakeHop, the researchers stated.\\n“SSL is an entirely new mathematical framework for neural network architecture developed from signal transform theory,” Kuo stated. “It is radically different from the traditional approach. It is very suitable for high-dimensional data that have short-, mid- and long-range covariance structures. SSL is a complete data-driven unsupervised framework, offering a brand-new tool for image processing and understanding tasks such as face biometrics.”\\nRead the source articles and information in a news release from the University of Washington, in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science,\\xa0 an account from SpaceNews,a release from the US Army Research Laboratory, and in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector.”',\n",

Founded in 2013 in Raleigh, N.C., the company has raised $209.5 million to date, according to Crunchbase. Demand for the company’s services soared in 2020 as schools shifted to online teaching and many companies permitted employees to work from home.\\n“More people are using digital products. Many had planned to go digital but they could not afford to wait. That created opportunities for us,” stated Todd Olson, cofounder and CEO, in an account in Newsweek. The company now has about 2,000 customers, including Verizon, RE/MAX, Health AB, John Wiley & Sons, LabCorp, Mercury Insurance, OpenTable, Okta, Salesforce and Zendesk. The company plans to hire 400 more employees this year to fuel its growth as it invests in its presence overseas in an effort to win more large customers. The company recently had 169 open positions.\\nRavi Kumar, President, Infosys\\nInfosys is a multinational IT services company headquartered in India that is expanding its workforce in North America. The company recently announced it would be hiring 500 people in Calgary, Alberta, Canada over the next three years, which would double its Canadian workforce to 4,000 employees. “Calgary is a natural next step of our Canadian expansion. The city is home to a thriving talent pool. We will tap into this talent and offer skills and opportunities that will build on the city’s economic strengths,” stated Ravi Kumar, President of Infosys, in a press release.\\nOver the last two years, Infosys has created 2,000 jobs across Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montreal.

The company will hire tech talent from fourteen educational institutions across the country, including the University of Calgary, University of Alberta, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Waterloo. Infosys also plans to hire 300 workers in Pennsylvania as part of its US hiring strategy, recruiting for a range of opportunities across technology and digital services, administration and operations.\\nAI is Where the Money Is\\nIn an analysis of millions of job postings across the US, the labor market information provider Burning Glass wanted to see which professions had the highest percentage of job postings requesting AI skills, according to an account from Dice. Data science was requested by 22.4% of the postings, by far the highest. Next was data engineer at 5.5%, database architect at 4.6% and network engineer/architect at 3.1%.\\nBurning Glass sees machine learning as a “defining skill” among data scientists, needed for day-to-day work. Overall, jobs requiring AI skills are expected to grow 43.4% over the next decade. The current median salary for jobs heavily using AI skills is $105,000, good compared to many other professions.\\nHiring managers will test for knowledge of fundamental concepts and ability to execute. A portfolio of AI-related projects can help a candidate’s prospects.\\nBurning Glass recently announced an expansion and update of its CyberSeek source of information on America’s cybersecurity workforce. “These updates are timely as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Strategic Plan aims to promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and multiple pathways to build and sustain a diverse and skilled workforce,” stated Rodney Petersen, Director of the NICE, in a Burning Glass press release\\nNICE is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused on supporting the country’s ability to address current and future cybersecurity education and workforce challenges.\\nTrends for AI in 2021 in the beginning of the latter stages of the global pandemic were highlighted in a recent account in VentureBeat as:\\n\\nHyperautomation, the application of AI and machine learning to augment workers and automate processes to a higher degree;\\nEthical AI, because consumers and employees expect companies to adopt AI in a responsible manner; companies will choose to do business with partners that commit to data ethics and data handling practices that reflect appropriate values;\\nAnd Workplace AI, to help with transitions to new models of work, especially with knowledge workers at home; AI will be used to augment customer services agents, to track employee health and for intelligent document extraction.\\n\\nRead the source articles and information in TechRepublic, in a press release from Novacoast, in Newsweek, in a press release from Infosys, in an account from Dice, in a Burning Glass press release and in an account in VentureBeat.',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\nCIOs have tested many emerging strategies during the pandemic, including the Internet of Things sensors, low-orbit satellites, and augmented reality. Now the challenge is to get the technologies to work together to reach for big business goals.\\nAdriana Karaboutis, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer, National Grid\\nThis was the message from Adriana Karaboutis, group chief information and digital officer at National Grid, speaking at the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium in a session on Accelerated Digital Transformation, held virtually recently.\\nThe effects of the crisis made organizations “double down on that focus and crystallization for what we need to do,” she stated in an account in CIO Dive\\nTo pursue IoT, standardization is a must, suggested Harmeen Mehta, chief digital and innovation officer at BT, the British multinational telecommunications firm. “If the world can consolidate a bit on standardization, it will help pick up speed,” stated Mehta. “What we’ve not done well as an industry is truly come together and make some hard choices” in converging around specific types of IoT technologies.\\nTechnologies and data streams playing off each other can lead to new outcomes, in the experience of David Neitz, CIO at engineering and construction company CDM Smith. Using NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano device, for example, CDM Smith is able to train an AI computer vision model to detect wrong-way drivers, he stated. The technology use case combines capabilities of sensors with the computing power of AI.\\n“You have someone sitting in a command center trying to monitor 300 screens,” stated Neitz, speaking on the panel. “Why rely on a human to be observant and alert?” Instead, the company relies on a mix of sensors and algorithms to monitor and track when drivers are using lanes in an erratic way, or how traffic is behaving around a construction zone.\\nAnother application finds CDM Smith combining IoT soil sensors, data analytics and weather information to predict when a potential landslide could impact a railroad track.\\nPandemic Has Accelerated the Move to Cloud Computing\\nThe pandemic seems to have accelerated the move to cloud computing. A recent survey of 750 cloud decision-makers found that 92% of represented enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 90% have a hybrid cloud strategy. The results are contained in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera, an IT asset management software company.\\nJim Ryan, President and CEO, Flexera\\n“COVID-19 has accelerated the migration to cloud computing,” stated Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Flexera, in a press release. “Still, cloud isn’t magic or the land of milk and honey. Companies are moving fast, facing challenges, and trying to connect cloud computing to business outcomes. The appetite for digital transformation is high, but real-world challenges—such as managing security and optimizing cloud spend—still must be addressed.”\\nCloud adoption among the respondents was as follows: AWS adoption grew to 77% (from 76% last year); Azure grew to 73% (from 63% last year); Google Cloud grew to 47% (from 35% last year); VMware Cloud on AWS grew to 24% (from 17% last year); Oracle Infrastructure Cloud grew to 29% (from 17% last year); IBM Public Cloud grew to 24% (from 13% last year); and Alibaba Cloud grew to 12% (from 7% last year).\\nThe key considerations CIOs are advised to take into account as they gravitate more of their IT operations to the cloud touch on infrastructure, processes and culture, advised a recent account in Forbes. They include:\\n\\nPutting Customers and Employees First. In the past year, organizations have transformed and served customers in new ways. Restaurants, for example, had to enable better ordering of food online to be picked up or delivered and paid for electronically. CIOs have transitioned from being “enablers” of digital transformation to being “drivers” of business change. The trend is seen as so produced that Gartner predicts that 25% of large-enterprise CIOs could become “COO by proxy” by 2024.\\nDeveloping ‘Enterprise Agility.’ Each company needs to determine its own path to competitive advantage, as in which approach to take for the digital and data journey, whether to emulate the infrastructure choices of digital native competitors or invent a new way as the company looks for a unique enterprise identity.\\n\\nIT Shifts Within Scaled, Agile Organizations\\nResearch from McKinsey & Co. on enterprise agility identifies five core IT shifts within scaled agile organizations. These include:\\n\\nSpeed. Information needs to be relevant, actionable & timely, whether for real-time scenarios such as fraud detection that triggers machine intervention, or monitoring that requires human judgment, “The notion of speed and pace is key,” stated the author of the Forbes account, Bruno Aziza, a technology entrepreneur who is the current Head of Data & Analytics for Google Cloud.\\nScale. The world is predicted to store 200 zettabytes [a zettabyte is 10 to the power of 21] of data by 2025, and 50% of all data will be in the cloud. “The question is: are your teams building for a world where capacity could be limitless? Or are they living in a world where only some data deserves to be stored?” Aziza queried. He suggests that team members look at more data; they don’t know which data will become more valuable over time.\\nSecurity. The number one concern of companies of all sizes in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report, is security. The higher the company’s cloud maturity, the higher the concern. In a world where more data comes from a range of sources and is used by more people across more use cases, security and data governance needs to be taken into account on day one, the author suggested.\\nHuman Intelligence. AI is important to digital transformation efforts; the AI Specialist is now one of the fastest growing jobs on LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report. Many organizations are looking to infuse AI to optimize their technical infrastructure and focus on the adoption of machine learning as part of intelligent application initiatives. “But many struggle to marry human intelligence with machine intelligence,” the author states. The best guidance he has found so far on when humans are better equipped than machines, is from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport, released in 2016.\\n\\nAziza recommends working to identify the use cases where machine intelligence is most appropriate and the ones where humans do a better job “augmenting” the machine’s capabilities.\\nRead the source articles and information from sessions of the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium, in CIO Dive, in a press release from Flexera, in Forbes and from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport.',\n",

The idea is to augment the decision-making of human users, to offer insights based on the past performance of DPR projects.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe automation can also be used in bid preparation and project planning. “The goal is to help our business development, operations, and scheduling folks make more informed decisions based on historical data so everything is more scientific, rather than someone’s bad feeling about something,” Maha stated.\\xa0\\nNiran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder, Kwant.ai\\nTo get more usable site data, DPR has also been trying outfitting workers with wearables containing Internet of Things sensors from Kwant.ai, a New York City-based software supplier focused on jobsite intelligence. The system helps with worker location and scheduling, and the company is working on applying machine learning to its datasets. “We never try to sell this by saying it will solve all your problems, but if you input all the data it will provide insights for you to take action,” stated Niran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder of Kwant.\\xa0\\nAs part of a panel on AI in Construction held by the Ontario General Contractors Association last year, Shrestha offered some insight into how AI can help estimate the needed manpower on a construction site.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We still don’t know how much manpower is required if you want to build an airport, a railroad or commercial building,” he stated in an account in\\xa0ConstructConnect.\\xa0“When you are making a cost and schedule for a new project what do you do? You look at your older schedule, and you try to compare the schedule and see if you can use that as a reference for the new project, for estimation, for manpower and for cost.

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.\\xa0Let’s explore why.\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area.\\xa0There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0is\\xa0unlawfully parked\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0making your turn,\\xa0and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYour mind races as you\\xa0consider\\xa0your options.\\xa0\\nYou could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your\\xa0turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0But\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.\\xa0\\nSadly, neither\\xa0option\\xa0is\\xa0satisfactory.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDriving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.\\xa0It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?\\xa0\\nYou might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0not\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoila:\\xa0the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene.\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.\\xa0\\nRather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.\\xa0There are some potential downsides.\\xa0\\nA human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0thing\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0take in extra information. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?\\xa0\\nLet’s unpack the matter and see.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nThe AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVia a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.\\xa0\\nThat’s bound to create difficulties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s something else to ponder.\\xa0Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.\\xa0This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0imagined. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’ll throw you another curveball.\\xa0Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?\\xa0\\nOn the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0viably\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.\\xa0\\nWithout seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can add more icing to that cake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.\\xa0\\nAll told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.\\xa0\\nVarious experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.\\xa0\\nFor example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0sensory\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI mention that this should be considered an\\xa0add-on\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.\\xa0\\nThere are other twists and turns to be considered.\\xa0\\nFor example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).\\xa0\\nThe key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0as including perhaps\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne last quick point for the moment on this topic:\\xa0There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.\\xa0\\nAll of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?\\xa0\\nSuppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSimilarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nPredictive maintenance (PdM)\\xa0has emerged as a killer AI app.\\xa0\\nIn the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.\\xa0These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.\\xa0\\nThese observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany. Not much was happening. “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in\\xa0IoT Business News. “Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings have changed. IoT Analytics analyst\\xa0Fernando Alberto\\xa0Brügge\\xa0stated,\\xa0“Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach. It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.”\\xa0\\nTechnical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlong with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions. IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB,\\xa0and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear. In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83%\\xa0of the cases. Some 45%\\xa0of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year. “This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore IoT Sensors Means More Precision\\xa0\\nImplemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers. As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMany projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy.\\xa0\\nThe move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing.\\xa0\\nMore predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance\\xa0 management systems (CMMS). Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReduced Downtime Results in Savings\\xa0\\nGains come from preventing downtime.\\xa0“Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,” stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from\\xa0TechTarget.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFelipe Parages, Senior Data Scientist, Valkyrie\\nAdvances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.\\xa0\\nIt used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way.\\xa0“Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,” stated Parages.\\xa0\\nAs a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. “Predictive maintenance “is a very powerful weapon,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10%\\xa0of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks—that\\xa0means better customer service and happier customers,” Miller stated. He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project.\\xa0\\nIn an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility. Atos, Dassault\\xa0Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, Groupe Renault\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Renault, stated in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics,\\xa0“In the new mobility value chain, on-board intelligence systems are the new driving force, where all research and investment are now concentrated. Faced with this technological challenge, we are choosing to play collectively and openly. There will be no center of gravity, the value of each will be multiplied by others. The combined expertise in cybersecurity, microelectronics, energy and data management will enable us to develop unique, cutting-edge solutions for low-carbon, shared, and responsible mobility, made in Europe.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Software République will be based in Guyancourt, a commune in north-central France at the Renault\\xa0Technocentre\\xa0in a building called\\xa0Odyssée, a 12,000 square meter space which is eco-responsible. For example, its interior and exterior structure is 100 percent wood, and the building is covered with photovoltaic panels.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles in\\xa0IoT Business News,\\xa0\\xa0TechTarget, and\\xa0in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics.',\n",

He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia’s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.\\xa0\\n“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS. He oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses\\xa0NVIDIA-Certified\\xa0edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another analysis, a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nContract Awarded in 2019 for System Using OCR\\xa0\\xa0\\nUSPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow. “In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.\\xa0\\nAI algorithms were developed on these NVIDIA DGX servers at a US Postal Service Engineering facility. (Credit: Nvidia)\\nToday, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software. Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or\\xa0PyTorch.\\xa0\\nThe deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added\\xa0\\nMultiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.\\xa0\\n“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne model,\\xa0for example,\\xa0automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight,\\xa0and destination. Another one that will automatically decipher a damaged barcode could be online this summer.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated.\\xa0\\nAccenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies,\\xa0and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0stated. Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to\\xa0Nextgov. “And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.”\\xa0\\nThe new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year. In mid-December, during the last holiday season, the agency delivered as little as 62% of first-class mail on time—the lowest level in years, according to an account in\\xa0VentureBeat\\xa0. The rate rebounded to 84% by the week of March 6 but remained below the agency’s target of about 96%.\\xa0\\nThe Postal Service has blamed the pandemic and record peak periods for much of the poor service performance.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0on the\\xa0Nvidia blog, in\\xa0Nextgov\\xa0and\\xa0in\\xa0VentureBeat.',\n",

              " {'content': 'By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\nNew laws will soon shape how companies use AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe five largest federal financial regulators in the US recently released a request for information how banks use AI, signaling that new guidance is coming for the finance business. Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in\\xa0Harvard Business Review.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See\\xa0AI Trends, April 22, 2021)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAndrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai\\nWhile we don’t know\\xa0what these regulation will allow, “Three\\xa0central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of\\xa0bnh.ai, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst,\\xa0conduct assessments of AI risks. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, Virginia’s recently-passed\\xa0Consumer Data Protection Act, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.\\xa0\\nThe EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.\\xa0The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSecond,\\xa0accountability and independence. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThird,\\xa0continuous review. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproaches in US, Europe and China Differ\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in\\xa0The Verdict, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.\\xa0\\n“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens. The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19.\\xa0\\n“Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.\\xa0\\nIn the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a\\xa0recent report\\xa0from\\xa0pwc, the multinational professional services firm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the\\xa0pwc\\xa0analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCritics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area\\xa0\\nWhile some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act\\xa0leaves too much gray area, the hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market\\n“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in\\xa0TechCrunch. AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.”\\xa0\\n“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”\\xa0\\n“So come here—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested.\\xa0\\nAnother reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.\\xa0\\nReactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.\\xa0\\n“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London. “The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo accomplish this, he suggested,\\xa0“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0in\\xa0Harvard Business Review, in\\xa0The Verdict\\xa0and in\\xa0TechCrunch.\\xa0',\n",

In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompanies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.\\xa0\\nCaleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud, Stash Financial\\n“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with\\xa0Pymnts.\\xa0\\nSIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on\\xa0CNET.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIdentity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated.\\xa0“To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGoing forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.\\xa0\\nAI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages\\xa0\\nAI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in\\xa0Forbes.\\xa0\\nDeepak Gupta, Cofounder and CTO,\\xa0LoginRadius\\n“AI has the power to save the world from digital identity fraud,” stated Deepak Gupta, author of the Forbes article and\\xa0cofounder\\xa0and CTO of\\xa0LoginRadius, a cloud-based consumer identity platform. “In the fight against ID theft, it is already a strong weapon. AI systems are entirely likely to end the reign of the individual hacker.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile he sees AI authentication as being in an early phase, Gupta recommended that companies examine the following: the use of intelligent adaptive authentication, such as local and device fingerprint; biometric authentication, based on the face or fingerprints; and smart data filters. “A well-developed AI protection system will have the ability to respond in nanoseconds to close a leak,” he stated.\\xa0\\nPandemic Altered Consumer Financial Behavior, Spurred Identity Fraud\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe global pandemic has had a dramatic impact on consumer financial behavior.

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur lives are filled with explanations.\\xa0You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.\\xa0\\nSo, you ask for an explanation.\\xa0\\nIn a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThough that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.\\xa0\\nKnowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.\\xa0\\nExplanations come in all shapes and sizes.\\xa0\\nA person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.\\xa0\\nThe explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.\\xa0\\nPerhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.\\xa0\\nThe person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to\\xa0notice\\xa0that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe usually take\\xa0these differences\\xa0for granted.\\xa0You rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has,\\xa0in the case of a medical diagnosis,\\xa0whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.\\xa0\\nAll told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.\\xa0\\nWe can add a twist on that twist.\\xa0Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.\\xa0Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.\\xa0\\nThat’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.\\xa0\\nAnother angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas\\xa0you\\xa0are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy all this talk about explanations?\\xa0Because of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNote that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.\\xa0\\nErgo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is known as Explainable AI (XAI).\\xa0\\nXAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTake as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.\\xa0\\nThis means that the AI is\\xa0not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.\\xa0\\nSome assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.\\xa0\\nThose are the pittance explanations.\\xa0\\nA more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOf course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question is this:\\xa0In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?\\xa0\\nLet’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And XAI\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s perfectly fine.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.\\xa0\\nIt could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.\\xa0\\nYou might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or\\xa0facets\\xa0about the explanation that was being provided.\\xa0\\nOkay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.\\xa0A self-driving car is taking you to your home.\\xa0The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.\\xa0\\nIn essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.\\xa0\\nYou would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.\\xa0\\nThe point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened. The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are lots and lots of situations that can arise when riding in a car and for which you might desire an explanation. The car is suddenly brought to a halt. The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWell, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.\\xa0\\nHumans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI. In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question.\\xa0\\nThe one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt least until the day that AI does become sentient, then you can certainly ask away.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\nDeepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.\\nDeepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat. Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.\\nBo Zhao, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Washington\\n“This isn’t just Photoshopping things. It’s making data look uncannily realistic,” stated Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the study, in a news release from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. “The techniques are already there. We’re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,” Zhao stated.\\nFake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.\\nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm\\nNow with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.\\n“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter\\xadconnected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from SpaceNews.\\nTo study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.\\nThe researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.\\nSimulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.\\nThe researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.\\nIn an interview with The Verge, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.\\n“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.\\nUS Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection\\nProfessor C.-C. Jay Kuo, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California\\nUS Army researchers are also working on a deepfake detection method. Researchers at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory, in collaboration with Professor C.C. Jay Kuo’s research group at the University of Southern California, are examining the threat that deepfakes pose to our society and national security, according to a release from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).\\nTheir work is featured in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector,” which will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2021 in July.\\nARL researchers Dr. Suya You and Dr. Shuowen (Sean) Hu noted that most state-of-the-art deepfake video detection and media forensics methods are based upon deep learning, which has inherent weaknesses in robustness, scalability, and portability.\\n“Due to the progression of generative neural networks, AI-driven deepfakes have advanced so rapidly that there is a scarcity of reliable techniques to detect and defend against them,” You stated. “We have an urgent need for an alternative paradigm that can understand the mechanism behind the startling performance of deepfakes, and to develop effective defense solutions with solid theoretical support.”\\nRelying on their experience with machine learning, signal analysis, and computer vision, the researchers developed a new theory and mathematical framework they call the Successive Subspace Learning, or SSL, as an innovative neural network architecture. SSL is the key innovation of DefakeHop, the researchers stated.\\n“SSL is an entirely new mathematical framework for neural network architecture developed from signal transform theory,” Kuo stated. “It is radically different from the traditional approach. It is very suitable for high-dimensional data that have short-, mid- and long-range covariance structures. SSL is a complete data-driven unsupervised framework, offering a brand-new tool for image processing and understanding tasks such as face biometrics.”\\nRead the source articles and information in a news release from the University of Washington, in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science,\\xa0 an account from SpaceNews,a release from the US Army Research Laboratory, and in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector.”',\n",

Now the challenge is to get the technologies to work together to reach for big business goals.\\nAdriana Karaboutis, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer, National Grid\\nThis was the message from Adriana Karaboutis, group chief information and digital officer at National Grid, speaking at the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium in a session on Accelerated Digital Transformation, held virtually recently.\\nThe effects of the crisis made organizations “double down on that focus and crystallization for what we need to do,” she stated in an account in CIO Dive\\nTo pursue IoT, standardization is a must, suggested Harmeen Mehta, chief digital and innovation officer at BT, the British multinational telecommunications firm. “If the world can consolidate a bit on standardization, it will help pick up speed,” stated Mehta. “What we’ve not done well as an industry is truly come together and make some hard choices” in converging around specific types of IoT technologies.\\nTechnologies and data streams playing off each other can lead to new outcomes, in the experience of David Neitz, CIO at engineering and construction company CDM Smith. Using NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano device, for example, CDM Smith is able to train an AI computer vision model to detect wrong-way drivers, he stated. The technology use case combines capabilities of sensors with the computing power of AI.\\n“You have someone sitting in a command center trying to monitor 300 screens,” stated Neitz, speaking on the panel. “Why rely on a human to be observant and alert?” Instead, the company relies on a mix of sensors and algorithms to monitor and track when drivers are using lanes in an erratic way, or how traffic is behaving around a construction zone.\\nAnother application finds CDM Smith combining IoT soil sensors, data analytics and weather information to predict when a potential landslide could impact a railroad track.\\nPandemic Has Accelerated the Move to Cloud Computing\\nThe pandemic seems to have accelerated the move to cloud computing. A recent survey of 750 cloud decision-makers found that 92% of represented enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 90% have a hybrid cloud strategy. The results are contained in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera, an IT asset management software company.\\nJim Ryan, President and CEO, Flexera\\n“COVID-19 has accelerated the migration to cloud computing,” stated Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Flexera, in a press release. “Still, cloud isn’t magic or the land of milk and honey. Companies are moving fast, facing challenges, and trying to connect cloud computing to business outcomes. The appetite for digital transformation is high, but real-world challenges—such as managing security and optimizing cloud spend—still must be addressed.”\\nCloud adoption among the respondents was as follows: AWS adoption grew to 77% (from 76% last year); Azure grew to 73% (from 63% last year); Google Cloud grew to 47% (from 35% last year); VMware Cloud on AWS grew to 24% (from 17% last year); Oracle Infrastructure Cloud grew to 29% (from 17% last year); IBM Public Cloud grew to 24% (from 13% last year); and Alibaba Cloud grew to 12% (from 7% last year).\\nThe key considerations CIOs are advised to take into account as they gravitate more of their IT operations to the cloud touch on infrastructure, processes and culture, advised a recent account in Forbes. They include:\\n\\nPutting Customers and Employees First. In the past year, organizations have transformed and served customers in new ways. Restaurants, for example, had to enable better ordering of food online to be picked up or delivered and paid for electronically. CIOs have transitioned from being “enablers” of digital transformation to being “drivers” of business change. The trend is seen as so produced that Gartner predicts that 25% of large-enterprise CIOs could become “COO by proxy” by 2024.\\nDeveloping ‘Enterprise Agility.’ Each company needs to determine its own path to competitive advantage, as in which approach to take for the digital and data journey, whether to emulate the infrastructure choices of digital native competitors or invent a new way as the company looks for a unique enterprise identity.\\n\\nIT Shifts Within Scaled, Agile Organizations\\nResearch from McKinsey & Co. on enterprise agility identifies five core IT shifts within scaled agile organizations. These include:\\n\\nSpeed. Information needs to be relevant, actionable & timely, whether for real-time scenarios such as fraud detection that triggers machine intervention, or monitoring that requires human judgment, “The notion of speed and pace is key,” stated the author of the Forbes account, Bruno Aziza, a technology entrepreneur who is the current Head of Data & Analytics for Google Cloud.\\nScale. The world is predicted to store 200 zettabytes [a zettabyte is 10 to the power of 21] of data by 2025, and 50% of all data will be in the cloud. “The question is: are your teams building for a world where capacity could be limitless? Or are they living in a world where only some data deserves to be stored?” Aziza queried. He suggests that team members look at more data; they don’t know which data will become more valuable over time.\\nSecurity. The number one concern of companies of all sizes in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report, is security. The higher the company’s cloud maturity, the higher the concern. In a world where more data comes from a range of sources and is used by more people across more use cases, security and data governance needs to be taken into account on day one, the author suggested.\\nHuman Intelligence. AI is important to digital transformation efforts; the AI Specialist is now one of the fastest growing jobs on LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report. Many organizations are looking to infuse AI to optimize their technical infrastructure and focus on the adoption of machine learning as part of intelligent application initiatives. “But many struggle to marry human intelligence with machine intelligence,” the author states. The best guidance he has found so far on when humans are better equipped than machines, is from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport, released in 2016.\\n\\nAziza recommends working to identify the use cases where machine intelligence is most appropriate and the ones where humans do a better job “augmenting” the machine’s capabilities.\\nRead the source articles and information from sessions of the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium, in CIO Dive, in a press release from Flexera, in Forbes and from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport.',\n",

The goal of Alice is to have its customers optimize project schedules and thereby reduce project duration and save on labor and equipment.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRené Morkos, Founder and CEO, Alice Technologies\\n“What I always hear from people [in the industry] is that ‘I really like scheduling, but the number crunching is the boring part,’” stated René Morkos, founder and CEO. “Why would anyone in their right mind want to spend time crunching all the constraints on a project? It’s mind-numbingly boring.” In his view, the construction industry is approaching a tipping point of AI adoption.\\xa0\\nAlice is used to run simulations of a project’s building information model, the digital representation of physical and functional space that spans architecture, engineering and construction, used to plan, design, construct and manage buildings. Users of Alice can adjust inputs, and the software shows the impact on the construction schedule, helpful in generating alternatives.\\xa0\\n“The fundamental value proposition of the general contractor is changing,” Morkos stated. “This new ecosystem will be all about integrated data systems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nProject Manager for New San Francisco High-Rise Likes Advice From AI\\xa0\\nWhile planning out staging for structural concrete on a $150 million, 20-story residential tower development in San Francisco, project director Michael MacBean of Pacific Structures uses Alice for its informed second opinion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We used it on\\xa0pre-construction\\xa0for that project to validate our approach and check our productivity,” he stated, while noting that his own experience as a project superintendent is most important. “The algorithm is awesome. Its ability to calculate every which way to skin the cat, if you will, gets that much better if you also have human expertise in construction,” stated MacBean.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Alice software helps him make decisions such as where to place a crane, whether to have workers put in eight-hour or 10-hour days, and whether to recruit 50 workers or 20. MacBean could have made the calculations on his own, but using the software was more efficient. “Alice does some pretty simple math, but it does it very quickly,” he stated.\\xa0\\nDPR Construction, an engineering company based in Redwood City, Calif., is developing its own AI-assisted build management program, relying on years of its own project data. “Some of the machine-learning projects we are working on right now, we’re not calling them AI. We’re calling them ‘AI assist’ or ‘human assist,’\\u2005” stated Hrishi Maha, DPR data analytics leader. The idea is to augment the decision-making of human users, to offer insights based on the past performance of DPR projects.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe automation can also be used in bid preparation and project planning. “The goal is to help our business development, operations, and scheduling folks make more informed decisions based on historical data so everything is more scientific, rather than someone’s bad feeling about something,” Maha stated.\\xa0\\nNiran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder, Kwant.ai\\nTo get more usable site data, DPR has also been trying outfitting workers with wearables containing Internet of Things sensors from Kwant.ai, a New York City-based software supplier focused on jobsite intelligence. The system helps with worker location and scheduling, and the company is working on applying machine learning to its datasets. “We never try to sell this by saying it will solve all your problems, but if you input all the data it will provide insights for you to take action,” stated Niran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder of Kwant.\\xa0\\nAs part of a panel on AI in Construction held by the Ontario General Contractors Association last year, Shrestha offered some insight into how AI can help estimate the needed manpower on a construction site.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We still don’t know how much manpower is required if you want to build an airport, a railroad or commercial building,” he stated in an account in\\xa0ConstructConnect.\\xa0“When you are making a cost and schedule for a new project what do you do? You look at your older schedule, and you try to compare the schedule and see if you can use that as a reference for the new project, for estimation, for manpower and for cost. Now imagine with AI you are not comparing one or two schedules… but you’re looking at thousands and thousands of data points that you’ve collected historically for years and years.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nA project manager with Cambria Design Build, Ltd., Milad\\xa0Khalili, also on the panel, stated that he saw the advantage of being able to access historical data quickly. “With the help of machine learning, AI and automation, you will have it so much faster and a few clicks away,” he stated. “It’s also going to help us eliminate the repetitive tasks that project managers, project coordinators, and different people and trades are doing at construction\\xa0sites. You\\xa0are saving a lot of time and money on labor and materials.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDrones Increasingly Used for Site Surveys, Construction Planning\\xa0\\xa0\\nDrones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\\xa0 are being increasingly employed on construction sites, to monitor progress and safety and to survey sites prior to the first dirt being shoveled. Drones can provide detailed, high-resolution images, enabling engineers to pinpoint potential issues and allow for effective deployment of equipment during construction, according to a recent account in\\xa0ForConstructionPros.com. Using drones to perform inspections also avoids the need to place workers at risk.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Simply put, drones enable us to provide needed views that are inaccessible, or otherwise too risky and expensive to capture by any other means,” stated Ryan Holmes, program manager of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for\\xa0Multivista\\xa0of Newton, Mass.,\\xa0which provides\\xa0UAV/drone services with remote pilots on staff. “We are using drones to help anywhere, from assessing land clearing and earthwork, insurance coverage, inspections, through to project completion and maintenance thereafter,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe data gathered through the drone can usually be accessed on any platform, be it desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, giving project data flexibility. Many companies optimize raw drone data to produce more clear drone images. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) drones, for example, use a GPS-correction technology that provides real-time location data corrections when capturing photos of a site.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The rise of RTK drones has provided a major step forward in providing accurate, repeatable results in a straightforward workflow, reducing one of the largest potential error sources in the placement and processing of\\xa0Ground Control Points (GCPs)\\xa0on earthwork projects,” stated Matthew Desmond, president of\\xa0Agtek\\xa0of Livermore, Calif., a supplier of survey, analysis and control software for the heavy construction industry.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0\\xa0in the\\xa0Engineering News-Record, in\\xa0ConstructConnect\\xa0and in\\xa0ForConstructionPros.com.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

              " {'content': 'By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.\\xa0Let’s explore why.\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area.\\xa0There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0is\\xa0unlawfully parked\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0making your turn,\\xa0and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYour mind races as you\\xa0consider\\xa0your options.\\xa0\\nYou could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your\\xa0turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0But\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.\\xa0\\nSadly, neither\\xa0option\\xa0is\\xa0satisfactory.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDriving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.\\xa0It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?\\xa0\\nYou might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0not\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoila:\\xa0the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene.\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.\\xa0\\nRather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.\\xa0There are some potential downsides.\\xa0\\nA human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0thing\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0take in extra information. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?\\xa0\\nLet’s unpack the matter and see.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nThe AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVia a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.\\xa0\\nThat’s bound to create difficulties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s something else to ponder.\\xa0Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.\\xa0This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0imagined. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’ll throw you another curveball.\\xa0Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?\\xa0\\nOn the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0viably\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.\\xa0\\nWithout seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can add more icing to that cake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.\\xa0\\nAll told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.\\xa0\\nVarious experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.\\xa0\\nFor example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0sensory\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI mention that this should be considered an\\xa0add-on\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.\\xa0\\nThere are other twists and turns to be considered.\\xa0\\nFor example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).\\xa0\\nThe key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0as including perhaps\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne last quick point for the moment on this topic:\\xa0There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.\\xa0\\nAll of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?\\xa0\\nSuppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSimilarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0',\n",

              "'By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\xa0\\nPredictive maintenance (PdM)\\xa0has emerged as a killer AI app.\\xa0\\nIn the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.\\xa0These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.\\xa0\\nThese observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany. Not much was happening. “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in\\xa0IoT Business News. “Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThings have changed. IoT Analytics analyst\\xa0Fernando Alberto\\xa0Brügge\\xa0stated,\\xa0“Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach. It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.”\\xa0\\nTechnical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlong with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions. IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB,\\xa0and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear. In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83%\\xa0of the cases. Some 45%\\xa0of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year. “This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMore IoT Sensors Means More Precision\\xa0\\nImplemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers. As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMany projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches.\\xa0AspenTech\\xa0has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy.\\xa0\\nThe move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing.\\xa0\\nMore predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance\\xa0 management systems (CMMS). Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nReduced Downtime Results in Savings\\xa0\\nGains come from preventing downtime.\\xa0“Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,” stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from\\xa0TechTarget.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFelipe Parages, Senior Data Scientist, Valkyrie\\nAdvances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.\\xa0\\nIt used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way.\\xa0“Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,” stated Parages.\\xa0\\nAs a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. “Predictive maintenance “is a very powerful weapon,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10%\\xa0of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks—that\\xa0means better customer service and happier customers,” Miller stated. He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project.\\xa0\\nIn an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility. Atos, Dassault\\xa0Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, Groupe Renault\\nLuca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Renault, stated in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics,\\xa0“In the new mobility value chain, on-board intelligence systems are the new driving force, where all research and investment are now concentrated. Faced with this technological challenge, we are choosing to play collectively and openly. There will be no center of gravity, the value of each will be multiplied by others. The combined expertise in cybersecurity, microelectronics, energy and data management will enable us to develop unique, cutting-edge solutions for low-carbon, shared, and responsible mobility, made in Europe.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Software République will be based in Guyancourt, a commune in north-central France at the Renault\\xa0Technocentre\\xa0in a building called\\xa0Odyssée, a 12,000 square meter space which is eco-responsible. For example, its interior and exterior structure is 100 percent wood, and the building is covered with photovoltaic panels.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles in\\xa0IoT Business News,\\xa0\\xa0TechTarget, and\\xa0in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from STMicroelectronics.By AI Trends Editor John P. Desmond\\xa0\\xa0\\nNVIDIA\\xa0on May 6 detailed a partnership with the US Postal Service underway for over a year to speed up mail service using AI, with a goal of reducing current processing time tasks that take days to hours.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project fields edge servers at 195 Post Services sites across the nation, which review 20 terabytes of images a day from 1,000 mail processing machines, according to a post on the\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0blog.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal, Nvidia\\n“The federal government has been for the last several years talking about the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategic imperative to our nation, and as an important funding priority. It’s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon. It’s been funded by billions of dollars, and it’s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for\\xa0NVIDIA, in an interview with\\xa0Nextgov.\\xa0\\xa0“And this is one of the few enterprise–wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post. (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0and others to design the needed deep-learning models. The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia’s EGX platform at USPS. The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge.\\xa0\\n“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS. He oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses\\xa0NVIDIA-Certified\\xa0edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn another analysis, a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.\\xa0\\xa0\\nContract Awarded in 2019 for System Using OCR\\xa0\\xa0\\nUSPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow. “In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.\\xa0\\nAI algorithms were developed on these NVIDIA DGX servers at a US Postal Service Engineering facility. (Credit: Nvidia)\\nToday, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software. Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or\\xa0PyTorch.\\xa0\\nThe deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. “We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added\\xa0\\nMultiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work. The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features. And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future.\\xa0\\n“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne model,\\xa0for example,\\xa0automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight,\\xa0and destination. Another one that will automatically decipher a damaged barcode could be online this summer.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated.\\xa0\\nAccenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies,\\xa0and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of\\xa0NVIDIA\\xa0stated. Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to\\xa0Nextgov. “And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.”\\xa0\\nThe new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year. In mid-December, during the last holiday season, the agency delivered as little as 62% of first-class mail on time—the lowest level in years, according to an account in\\xa0VentureBeat\\xa0. The rate rebounded to 84% by the week of March 6 but remained below the agency’s target of about 96%.\\xa0\\nThe Postal Service has blamed the pandemic and record peak periods for much of the poor service performance.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0on the\\xa0Nvidia blog, in\\xa0Nextgov\\xa0and\\xa0in\\xa0VentureBeat.By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\nNew laws will soon shape how companies use AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe five largest federal financial regulators in the US recently released a request for information how banks use AI, signaling that new guidance is coming for the finance business. Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in\\xa0Harvard Business Review.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See\\xa0AI Trends, April 22, 2021)\\xa0\\xa0\\nAndrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai\\nWhile we don’t know\\xa0what these regulation will allow, “Three\\xa0central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of\\xa0bnh.ai, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst,\\xa0conduct assessments of AI risks. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, Virginia’s recently-passed\\xa0Consumer Data Protection Act, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms.\\xa0\\nThe EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states. The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019.\\xa0The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced.\\xa0\\xa0\\nSecond,\\xa0accountability and independence. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThird,\\xa0continuous review. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nApproaches in US, Europe and China Differ\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in\\xa0The Verdict, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.\\xa0\\n“Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens. The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19.\\xa0\\n“Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.\\xa0\\nIn the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a\\xa0recent report\\xa0from\\xa0pwc, the multinational professional services firm.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the\\xa0pwc\\xa0analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCritics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area\\xa0\\nWhile some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act\\xa0leaves too much gray area, the hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market\\n“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in\\xa0TechCrunch. AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.”\\xa0\\n“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe! You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.”\\xa0\\n“So come here—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines. We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested.\\xa0\\nAnother reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.\\xa0\\nReactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.\\xa0\\n“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London. “The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial. This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo accomplish this, he suggested,\\xa0“The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.”\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0in\\xa0Harvard Business Review, in\\xa0The Verdict\\xa0and in\\xa0TechCrunch.\\xa0By AI Trends Staff\\xa0\\nCyberattacks and identity fraud losses increased dramatically in 2020 as the pandemic made remote work the norm, setting the stage for AI and biometrics to combine in efforts to attain a higher level of protection.\\xa0\\nOne study found banks worldwide saw a 238% jump in cyberattacks between February and April 2020; a study from Javelin Strategy & Research found that identity fraud losses grew to $56 billion last year as fraudsters used stolen personal information to create synthetic identities, according to a recent account from\\xa0Pymnts.com. In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.\\xa0\\xa0\\nCompanies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.\\xa0\\nCaleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud, Stash Financial\\n“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with\\xa0Pymnts.\\xa0\\nSIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on\\xa0CNET.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIdentity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated.\\xa0“To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAsked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nGoing forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.\\xa0\\nAI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages\\xa0\\nAI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in\\xa0Forbes.\\xa0\\nDeepak Gupta, Cofounder and CTO,\\xa0LoginRadius\\n“AI has the power to save the world from digital identity fraud,” stated Deepak Gupta, author of the Forbes article and\\xa0cofounder\\xa0and CTO of\\xa0LoginRadius, a cloud-based consumer identity platform. “In the fight against ID theft, it is already a strong weapon. AI systems are entirely likely to end the reign of the individual hacker.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhile he sees AI authentication as being in an early phase, Gupta recommended that companies examine the following: the use of intelligent adaptive authentication, such as local and device fingerprint; biometric authentication, based on the face or fingerprints; and smart data filters. “A well-developed AI protection system will have the ability to respond in nanoseconds to close a leak,” he stated.\\xa0\\nPandemic Altered Consumer Financial Behavior, Spurred Identity Fraud\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe global pandemic has had a dramatic impact on consumer financial behavior. Consumers spent more time at home in 2020, transacted less than in previous years, and relied heavily on streaming services, digital commerce, and payments. They also corresponded more via email and text, for both work and personal life.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The pandemic inspired a major shift in how criminals approach fraud,” stated\\xa0John Buzzard, Lead Analyst, Fraud & Security, with Javelin Strategy & Research in a\\xa0press release.\\xa0“Identity fraud has evolved and now reflects the lengths criminals will take to directly target consumers in order to steal their personally identifiable information.”\\xa0\\nCompanies made quick adjustments to their business models, such as by increasing remote interactions with borrowers for loan originations and closings, and criminals pounced on new vulnerabilities they discovered.\\xa0Nearly one-third of identity fraud victims say their financial services providers did not satisfactorily resolve their problems, and 38% of victims closed their accounts because of lack of resolution, the Javelin researchers found.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“It is clear that financial institutions must continue to proactively and transparently manage fraud as a means to deepen their customer relationships,” stated Eric Kraus, Vice President and General Manager of Fraud, Risk and Compliance, FIS. The company offers technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms globally. “Through our continuing business relationships with financial institutions, we know firsthand that consumers are looking to their banks to resolve instances of fraud, regardless of how the fraud occurred,” he added.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis push from consumers who are becoming increasingly savvy online will lay a foundation for safer digital transactions.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Static forms of consumer authentication must be replaced with a modern, standards-based approach that utilizes biometrics,” stated David\\xa0Henstock, Vice President of Identity Products at Visa, the world’s leader in digital payments. “Businesses benefit from reduced customer friction, lower abandonment rates and fewer chargebacks, while consumers benefit from better fraud prevention and faster payment during checkout.”\\xa0\\nThe\\xa02021 Identity Fraud Study\\xa0from Javelin is now in its 18th year.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0from\\xa0Pymnts.com, from\\xa0CNET,\\xa0in\\xa0Forbes\\xa0and in a\\xa0press release\\xa0from\\xa0Javelin Strategy & Research.\\xa0By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur lives are filled with explanations.\\xa0You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.\\xa0\\nSo, you ask for an explanation.\\xa0\\nIn a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed. That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations. Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct. The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action. Period, end of story.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations. There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. Hospitals have their own in-house courses. Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThough that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue.\\xa0\\nKnowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science. You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.\\xa0\\nExplanations come in all shapes and sizes.\\xa0\\nA person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles. The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes.\\xa0\\nThe explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation. Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get. They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.\\xa0\\nPerhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do. The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.\\xa0\\nThe person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to\\xa0notice\\xa0that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe usually take\\xa0these differences\\xa0for granted.\\xa0You rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have. Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful. Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has,\\xa0in the case of a medical diagnosis,\\xa0whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet. They just want an explanation (or so they say). Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed. This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation.\\xa0\\nAll told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. This is certainly a sensible aspect. If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist. In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other.\\xa0\\nWe can add a twist on that twist.\\xa0Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one.\\xa0Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.\\xa0\\nThat’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand.\\xa0\\nAnother angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas\\xa0you\\xa0are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy all this talk about explanations?\\xa0Because of AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions. If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNote that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation.\\xa0\\nErgo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation. Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is known as Explainable AI (XAI).\\xa0\\nXAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTake as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns. Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way.\\xa0\\nThis means that the AI is\\xa0not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component. This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms.\\xa0\\nSome assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised. Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAmidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied. Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations. There is no interaction. There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.\\xa0\\nThose are the pittance explanations.\\xa0\\nA more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnd this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation. The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOf course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra. There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI. We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question is this:\\xa0In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?\\xa0\\nLet’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThese driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0\\nMeanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And XAI\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nOne aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0\\nBecause I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNow that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale. There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination. No need to chat. You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat’s perfectly fine.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual. You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination. They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver.\\xa0\\nIt could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation. Humans do that. In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.\\xa0\\nYou might be satisfied with that explanation. On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place. Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction. In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or\\xa0facets\\xa0about the explanation that was being provided.\\xa0\\nOkay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.\\xa0A self-driving car is taking you to your home.\\xa0The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system. You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal. Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars.\\xa0\\nIn essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. This is something that won’t be especially scalable. In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAssume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri. The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes. The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action.\\xa0\\nYou would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation. If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like. There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so. You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent. This might take a few moments to engage.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOnce the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars. You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes.\\xa0\\nThe point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened. The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nConclusion\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere are lots and lots of situations that can arise when riding in a car and for which you might desire an explanation. The car is suddenly brought to a halt. The car takes a curve rather strongly. The car veers into an adjacent lane without a comfortable margin of error. The car takes a road that you weren’t expecting to be on. Seemingly endless possibilities exist.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that case, if indeed XAI is notably handy for self-driving cars, you might be wondering why it isn’t especially in place already.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWell, admittedly, for those AI developers under intense pressures to devise AI that can drive a car from point A to point B, doing so safely, the aspect of providing machine-generated explanations is pretty low on their priority list. They would fervently argue that it is a so-called edge or corner case. It can be gotten to when the sunshine of having achieved sufficiently self-driving cars has been achieved.\\xa0\\nHumans that are riding in AVs of all kinds are going to want to have explanations. A cost-effective and immediately available means of providing explanations entails the embodiment of XAI into the AI systems that are doing the autonomous piloting.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne supposes that if you are inside a self-driving car and it is urgently doing some acrobatic driving maneuver, you might be hesitant to ask what is going on, in the same manner, that you might worry that you would be distracting a human driver that was doing something wild at the wheel.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPresumably, a well-devised XAI won’t be taxing on the AI driving system, and thus you are free to engage in a lengthy dialogue with the XAI. In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question.\\xa0\\nThe one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAt least until the day that AI does become sentient, then you can certainly ask away.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0By John P. Desmond, AI Trends Editor\\nDeepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness. Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.\\nDeepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat. Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.\\nBo Zhao, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Washington\\n“This isn’t just Photoshopping things. It’s making data look uncannily realistic,” stated Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the study, in a news release from the University of Washington. The study was published on April 21 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science. “The techniques are already there. We’re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,” Zhao stated.\\nFake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement.\\nNational Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm\\nNow with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks. The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019.\\n“We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter\\xadconnected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from SpaceNews.\\nTo study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files. When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this.\\nThe researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes.\\nSimulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such.\\nThe researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated. “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said.\\nIn an interview with The Verge, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.\\n“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.\\nUS Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection\\nProfessor C.-C. Jay Kuo, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Southern California\\nUS Army researchers are also working on a deepfake detection method. Researchers at the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, known as DEVCOM, Army Research Laboratory, in collaboration with Professor C.C. Jay Kuo’s research group at the University of Southern California, are examining the threat that deepfakes pose to our society and national security, according to a release from the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL).\\nTheir work is featured in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector,” which will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo 2021 in July.\\nARL researchers Dr. Suya You and Dr. Shuowen (Sean) Hu noted that most state-of-the-art deepfake video detection and media forensics methods are based upon deep learning, which has inherent weaknesses in robustness, scalability, and portability.\\n“Due to the progression of generative neural networks, AI-driven deepfakes have advanced so rapidly that there is a scarcity of reliable techniques to detect and defend against them,” You stated. “We have an urgent need for an alternative paradigm that can understand the mechanism behind the startling performance of deepfakes, and to develop effective defense solutions with solid theoretical support.”\\nRelying on their experience with machine learning, signal analysis, and computer vision, the researchers developed a new theory and mathematical framework they call the Successive Subspace Learning, or SSL, as an innovative neural network architecture. SSL is the key innovation of DefakeHop, the researchers stated.\\n“SSL is an entirely new mathematical framework for neural network architecture developed from signal transform theory,” Kuo stated. “It is radically different from the traditional approach. It is very suitable for high-dimensional data that have short-, mid- and long-range covariance structures. SSL is a complete data-driven unsupervised framework, offering a brand-new tool for image processing and understanding tasks such as face biometrics.”\\nRead the source articles and information in a news release from the University of Washington, in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science,\\xa0 an account from SpaceNews,a release from the US Army Research Laboratory, and in the paper titled “DefakeHop: A light-weight high-performance deepfake detector.”By John P.

Founded in 1996 in Santa Barbara, the company has many remote employees and a presence in the UK, Canada, Mexico, and Guatemala.\\nThe company offers a security operations center (SOC) cloud offering called novaSOC, that analyzes emerging challenges. “We work to have an answer ready before we’ve been asked,” stated CEO Paul Anderson in a press release issued on the company’s inclusion on a list of the top 250 Managed Service Providers from MSSP Alert. novaSOC automatically collects endpoint data and correlates it with threat intelligence sources, adding in analysis and reporting to make a responsive security monitoring service. Novacoast is planning to hire 60 employees to open a new SOC in Wichita, Kansas.\\nPendo is an information technology services company that provides step-by-step guides to help workers master new software packages. The software aims to boost employee proficiency through personalized training and automated support. Founded in 2013 in Raleigh, N.C., the company has raised $209.5 million to date, according to Crunchbase. Demand for the company’s services soared in 2020 as schools shifted to online teaching and many companies permitted employees to work from home.\\n“More people are using digital products. Many had planned to go digital but they could not afford to wait. That created opportunities for us,” stated Todd Olson, cofounder and CEO, in an account in Newsweek. The company now has about 2,000 customers, including Verizon, RE/MAX, Health AB, John Wiley & Sons, LabCorp, Mercury Insurance, OpenTable, Okta, Salesforce and Zendesk. The company plans to hire 400 more employees this year to fuel its growth as it invests in its presence overseas in an effort to win more large customers. The company recently had 169 open positions.\\nRavi Kumar, President, Infosys\\nInfosys is a multinational IT services company headquartered in India that is expanding its workforce in North America. The company recently announced it would be hiring 500 people in Calgary, Alberta, Canada over the next three years, which would double its Canadian workforce to 4,000 employees. “Calgary is a natural next step of our Canadian expansion. The city is home to a thriving talent pool. We will tap into this talent and offer skills and opportunities that will build on the city’s economic strengths,” stated Ravi Kumar, President of Infosys, in a press release.\\nOver the last two years, Infosys has created 2,000 jobs across Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, and Montreal. The Calgary expansion will enable Infosys to scale work with clients in Western Canada, Pacific Northwest, and the Central United States across various industries, including natural resources, energy, media, retail, and communications. The company will hire tech talent from fourteen educational institutions across the country, including the University of Calgary, University of Alberta, Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Waterloo. Infosys also plans to hire 300 workers in Pennsylvania as part of its US hiring strategy, recruiting for a range of opportunities across technology and digital services, administration and operations.\\nAI is Where the Money Is\\nIn an analysis of millions of job postings across the US, the labor market information provider Burning Glass wanted to see which professions had the highest percentage of job postings requesting AI skills, according to an account from Dice. Data science was requested by 22.4% of the postings, by far the highest. Next was data engineer at 5.5%, database architect at 4.6% and network engineer/architect at 3.1%.\\nBurning Glass sees machine learning as a “defining skill” among data scientists, needed for day-to-day work. Overall, jobs requiring AI skills are expected to grow 43.4% over the next decade. The current median salary for jobs heavily using AI skills is $105,000, good compared to many other professions.\\nHiring managers will test for knowledge of fundamental concepts and ability to execute. A portfolio of AI-related projects can help a candidate’s prospects.\\nBurning Glass recently announced an expansion and update of its CyberSeek source of information on America’s cybersecurity workforce. “These updates are timely as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Strategic Plan aims to promote the discovery of cybersecurity careers and multiple pathways to build and sustain a diverse and skilled workforce,” stated Rodney Petersen, Director of the NICE, in a Burning Glass press release\\nNICE is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused on supporting the country’s ability to address current and future cybersecurity education and workforce challenges.\\nTrends for AI in 2021 in the beginning of the latter stages of the global pandemic were highlighted in a recent account in VentureBeat as:\\n\\nHyperautomation, the application of AI and machine learning to augment workers and automate processes to a higher degree;\\nEthical AI, because consumers and employees expect companies to adopt AI in a responsible manner; companies will choose to do business with partners that commit to data ethics and data handling practices that reflect appropriate values;\\nAnd Workplace AI, to help with transitions to new models of work, especially with knowledge workers at home; AI will be used to augment customer services agents, to track employee health and for intelligent document extraction.\\n\\nRead the source articles and information in TechRepublic, in a press release from Novacoast, in Newsweek, in a press release from Infosys, in an account from Dice, in a Burning Glass press release and in an account in VentureBeat.By AI Trends Staff\\nCIOs have tested many emerging strategies during the pandemic, including the Internet of Things sensors, low-orbit satellites, and augmented reality. Now the challenge is to get the technologies to work together to reach for big business goals.\\nAdriana Karaboutis, Group Chief Information and Digital Officer, National Grid\\nThis was the message from Adriana Karaboutis, group chief information and digital officer at National Grid, speaking at the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium in a session on Accelerated Digital Transformation, held virtually recently.\\nThe effects of the crisis made organizations “double down on that focus and crystallization for what we need to do,” she stated in an account in CIO Dive\\nTo pursue IoT, standardization is a must, suggested Harmeen Mehta, chief digital and innovation officer at BT, the British multinational telecommunications firm. “If the world can consolidate a bit on standardization, it will help pick up speed,” stated Mehta. “What we’ve not done well as an industry is truly come together and make some hard choices” in converging around specific types of IoT technologies.\\nTechnologies and data streams playing off each other can lead to new outcomes, in the experience of David Neitz, CIO at engineering and construction company CDM Smith. Using NVIDIA’s Jetson Nano device, for example, CDM Smith is able to train an AI computer vision model to detect wrong-way drivers, he stated. The technology use case combines capabilities of sensors with the computing power of AI.\\n“You have someone sitting in a command center trying to monitor 300 screens,” stated Neitz, speaking on the panel. “Why rely on a human to be observant and alert?” Instead, the company relies on a mix of sensors and algorithms to monitor and track when drivers are using lanes in an erratic way, or how traffic is behaving around a construction zone.\\nAnother application finds CDM Smith combining IoT soil sensors, data analytics and weather information to predict when a potential landslide could impact a railroad track.\\nPandemic Has Accelerated the Move to Cloud Computing\\nThe pandemic seems to have accelerated the move to cloud computing. A recent survey of 750 cloud decision-makers found that 92% of represented enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy, and 90% have a hybrid cloud strategy. The results are contained in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera, an IT asset management software company.\\nJim Ryan, President and CEO, Flexera\\n“COVID-19 has accelerated the migration to cloud computing,” stated Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Flexera, in a press release. “Still, cloud isn’t magic or the land of milk and honey. Companies are moving fast, facing challenges, and trying to connect cloud computing to business outcomes. The appetite for digital transformation is high, but real-world challenges—such as managing security and optimizing cloud spend—still must be addressed.”\\nCloud adoption among the respondents was as follows: AWS adoption grew to 77% (from 76% last year); Azure grew to 73% (from 63% last year); Google Cloud grew to 47% (from 35% last year); VMware Cloud on AWS grew to 24% (from 17% last year); Oracle Infrastructure Cloud grew to 29% (from 17% last year); IBM Public Cloud grew to 24% (from 13% last year); and Alibaba Cloud grew to 12% (from 7% last year).\\nThe key considerations CIOs are advised to take into account as they gravitate more of their IT operations to the cloud touch on infrastructure, processes and culture, advised a recent account in Forbes. They include:\\n\\nPutting Customers and Employees First. In the past year, organizations have transformed and served customers in new ways. Restaurants, for example, had to enable better ordering of food online to be picked up or delivered and paid for electronically. CIOs have transitioned from being “enablers” of digital transformation to being “drivers” of business change. The trend is seen as so produced that Gartner predicts that 25% of large-enterprise CIOs could become “COO by proxy” by 2024.\\nDeveloping ‘Enterprise Agility.’ Each company needs to determine its own path to competitive advantage, as in which approach to take for the digital and data journey, whether to emulate the infrastructure choices of digital native competitors or invent a new way as the company looks for a unique enterprise identity.\\n\\nIT Shifts Within Scaled, Agile Organizations\\nResearch from McKinsey & Co. on enterprise agility identifies five core IT shifts within scaled agile organizations. These include:\\n\\nSpeed. Information needs to be relevant, actionable & timely, whether for real-time scenarios such as fraud detection that triggers machine intervention, or monitoring that requires human judgment, “The notion of speed and pace is key,” stated the author of the Forbes account, Bruno Aziza, a technology entrepreneur who is the current Head of Data & Analytics for Google Cloud.\\nScale. The world is predicted to store 200 zettabytes [a zettabyte is 10 to the power of 21] of data by 2025, and 50% of all data will be in the cloud. “The question is: are your teams building for a world where capacity could be limitless? Or are they living in a world where only some data deserves to be stored?” Aziza queried. He suggests that team members look at more data; they don’t know which data will become more valuable over time.\\nSecurity. The number one concern of companies of all sizes in the 2021 State of the Cloud Report, is security. The higher the company’s cloud maturity, the higher the concern. In a world where more data comes from a range of sources and is used by more people across more use cases, security and data governance needs to be taken into account on day one, the author suggested.\\nHuman Intelligence. AI is important to digital transformation efforts; the AI Specialist is now one of the fastest growing jobs on LinkedIn’s 2020 Emerging Jobs Report. Many organizations are looking to infuse AI to optimize their technical infrastructure and focus on the adoption of machine learning as part of intelligent application initiatives. “But many struggle to marry human intelligence with machine intelligence,” the author states. The best guidance he has found so far on when humans are better equipped than machines, is from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport, released in 2016.\\n\\nAziza recommends working to identify the use cases where machine intelligence is most appropriate and the ones where humans do a better job “augmenting” the machine’s capabilities.\\nRead the source articles and information from sessions of the 2021 MIT CIO Symposium, in CIO Dive, in a press release from Flexera, in Forbes and from the book Only Humans Need Apply by Tom Davenport.By AI Trends Staff \\xa0\\xa0\\nAI is starting to become useful in the construction industry as firms have built the data lakes and analytics systems necessary for AI to provide useful advice on how to plan, schedule, and execute projects.\\xa0\\nIn some cases, the AI advisors have become a standard ingredient of project delivery methods, and in other cases, it is a challenge to convince construction professionals to listen to the AI advisors, according to a recent account in the\\xa0Engineering News-Record.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAlice Technologies, offering an AI-powered construction simulation platform, was founded in 2015 based on research from Stanford University. The company has raised $38.3 million to date, according to Crunchbase. The goal of Alice is to have its customers optimize project schedules and thereby reduce project duration and save on labor and equipment.\\xa0\\xa0\\nRené Morkos, Founder and CEO, Alice Technologies\\n“What I always hear from people [in the industry] is that ‘I really like scheduling, but the number crunching is the boring part,’” stated René Morkos, founder and CEO. “Why would anyone in their right mind want to spend time crunching all the constraints on a project? It’s mind-numbingly boring.” In his view, the construction industry is approaching a tipping point of AI adoption.\\xa0\\nAlice is used to run simulations of a project’s building information model, the digital representation of physical and functional space that spans architecture, engineering and construction, used to plan, design, construct and manage buildings. Users of Alice can adjust inputs, and the software shows the impact on the construction schedule, helpful in generating alternatives.\\xa0\\n“The fundamental value proposition of the general contractor is changing,” Morkos stated. “This new ecosystem will be all about integrated data systems.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nProject Manager for New San Francisco High-Rise Likes Advice From AI\\xa0\\nWhile planning out staging for structural concrete on a $150 million, 20-story residential tower development in San Francisco, project director Michael MacBean of Pacific Structures uses Alice for its informed second opinion.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We used it on\\xa0pre-construction\\xa0for that project to validate our approach and check our productivity,” he stated, while noting that his own experience as a project superintendent is most important. “The algorithm is awesome. Its ability to calculate every which way to skin the cat, if you will, gets that much better if you also have human expertise in construction,” stated MacBean.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe Alice software helps him make decisions such as where to place a crane, whether to have workers put in eight-hour or 10-hour days, and whether to recruit 50 workers or 20. MacBean could have made the calculations on his own, but using the software was more efficient. “Alice does some pretty simple math, but it does it very quickly,” he stated.\\xa0\\nDPR Construction, an engineering company based in Redwood City, Calif., is developing its own AI-assisted build management program, relying on years of its own project data. “Some of the machine-learning projects we are working on right now, we’re not calling them AI. We’re calling them ‘AI assist’ or ‘human assist,’\\u2005” stated Hrishi Maha, DPR data analytics leader. The idea is to augment the decision-making of human users, to offer insights based on the past performance of DPR projects.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe automation can also be used in bid preparation and project planning. “The goal is to help our business development, operations, and scheduling folks make more informed decisions based on historical data so everything is more scientific, rather than someone’s bad feeling about something,” Maha stated.\\xa0\\nNiran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder, Kwant.ai\\nTo get more usable site data, DPR has also been trying outfitting workers with wearables containing Internet of Things sensors from Kwant.ai, a New York City-based software supplier focused on jobsite intelligence. The system helps with worker location and scheduling, and the company is working on applying machine learning to its datasets. “We never try to sell this by saying it will solve all your problems, but if you input all the data it will provide insights for you to take action,” stated Niran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder of Kwant.\\xa0\\nAs part of a panel on AI in Construction held by the Ontario General Contractors Association last year, Shrestha offered some insight into how AI can help estimate the needed manpower on a construction site.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We still don’t know how much manpower is required if you want to build an airport, a railroad or commercial building,” he stated in an account in\\xa0ConstructConnect.\\xa0“When you are making a cost and schedule for a new project what do you do? You look at your older schedule, and you try to compare the schedule and see if you can use that as a reference for the new project, for estimation, for manpower and for cost. Now imagine with AI you are not comparing one or two schedules… but you’re looking at thousands and thousands of data points that you’ve collected historically for years and years.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nA project manager with Cambria Design Build, Ltd., Milad\\xa0Khalili, also on the panel, stated that he saw the advantage of being able to access historical data quickly. “With the help of machine learning, AI and automation, you will have it so much faster and a few clicks away,” he stated. “It’s also going to help us eliminate the repetitive tasks that project managers, project coordinators, and different people and trades are doing at construction\\xa0sites. You\\xa0are saving a lot of time and money on labor and materials.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nDrones Increasingly Used for Site Surveys, Construction Planning\\xa0\\xa0\\nDrones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)\\xa0 are being increasingly employed on construction sites, to monitor progress and safety and to survey sites prior to the first dirt being shoveled. Drones can provide detailed, high-resolution images, enabling engineers to pinpoint potential issues and allow for effective deployment of equipment during construction, according to a recent account in\\xa0ForConstructionPros.com. Using drones to perform inspections also avoids the need to place workers at risk.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Simply put, drones enable us to provide needed views that are inaccessible, or otherwise too risky and expensive to capture by any other means,” stated Ryan Holmes, program manager of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for\\xa0Multivista\\xa0of Newton, Mass.,\\xa0which provides\\xa0UAV/drone services with remote pilots on staff. “We are using drones to help anywhere, from assessing land clearing and earthwork, insurance coverage, inspections, through to project completion and maintenance thereafter,” he stated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe data gathered through the drone can usually be accessed on any platform, be it desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, giving project data flexibility. Many companies optimize raw drone data to produce more clear drone images. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) drones, for example, use a GPS-correction technology that provides real-time location data corrections when capturing photos of a site.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The rise of RTK drones has provided a major step forward in providing accurate, repeatable results in a straightforward workflow, reducing one of the largest potential error sources in the placement and processing of\\xa0Ground Control Points (GCPs)\\xa0on earthwork projects,” stated Matthew Desmond, president of\\xa0Agtek\\xa0of Livermore, Calif., a supplier of survey, analysis and control software for the heavy construction industry.\\xa0\\nRead the source articles and information\\xa0\\xa0in the\\xa0Engineering News-Record, in\\xa0ConstructConnect\\xa0and in\\xa0ForConstructionPros.com.\\xa0\\xa0By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhen driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.\\xa0Let’s explore why.\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area.\\xa0There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that\\xa0is\\xa0unlawfully parked\\xa0in the active lane. You didn’t see the halted car until\\xa0making your turn,\\xa0and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYour mind races as you\\xa0consider\\xa0your options.\\xa0\\nYou could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your\\xa0turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car.\\xa0But\\xa0other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions.\\xa0\\nSadly, neither\\xa0option\\xa0is\\xa0satisfactory.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis is the nature of driving. You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions. Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAll it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you). Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured. There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDriving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks.\\xa0It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks. The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle. Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhat could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?\\xa0\\nYou might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind. Alternatively, you might have chosen to\\xa0not\\xa0make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two. In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVoila:\\xa0the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the\\xa0turn. That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nImagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene. There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene.\\xa0Now that’s some kind of driving.\\xa0\\nRather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now. Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at. The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a\\xa0wiser\\xa0choice with this added vantage point.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices. For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on. This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene.\\xa0There are some potential downsides.\\xa0\\nA human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at\\xa0thing\\xa0at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe question arises as to how a human driver can\\xa0take in extra information. This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle. You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts. And so on.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision. They are then held culpable for not having used the capability. Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nShifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars. Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.\\xa0Here is an intriguing question:\\xa0Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene?\\xa0\\nLet’s unpack the matter and see.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/\\xa0\\nWhy this is a moonshot effort, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/self-driving-car-mother-ai-projects-moonshot/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more about the levels as a type of Richter scale, see my discussion here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/richter-scale-levels-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor the argument about bifurcating the levels, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/reframing-ai-levels-for-self-driving-cars-bifurcation-of-autonomy/\\xa0\\nUnderstanding The Levels Of Self-Driving Cars\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAs a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.\\xa0These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3. The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.\\xa0Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSince semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.\\xa0\\nFor why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nTo be wary of fake news about self-driving cars, see my tips here:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/ai-fake-news-about-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe ethical implications of AI driving systems are significant, see my indication here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/ethically-ambiguous-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBe aware of the pitfalls of normalization of deviance when it comes to self-driving cars, here’s my call to arms:\\xa0https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/normalization-of-deviance-endangers-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nSelf-Driving Cars And Bird’s Eye View\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.\\xa0All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.\\xa0\\nThe AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWhy this\\xa0added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?\\xa0Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI. Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWith that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene. This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nLet’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFirst, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective. As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices. In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data. This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car. Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nVia a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOkay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view.\\xa0We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSuppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time. In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.\\xa0\\nThat’s bound to create difficulties.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued. The latency is a factor. That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received. Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite. In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF). You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nHere’s something else to ponder.\\xa0Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected.\\xa0This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so. Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received. All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data. Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThis seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane? Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly? A zillion questions can be\\xa0imagined. Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car. There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nI’ll throw you another curveball.\\xa0Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?\\xa0\\nOn the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset. At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer\\xa0viably\\xa0accurate about the driving scene. Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked. The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task.\\xa0\\nWithout seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene. You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThat being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide\\xa0attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe can add more icing to that cake.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages. Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.\\xa0\\nAll told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. This data needs to be computationally examined. There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications.\\xa0\\nVarious experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.\\xa0\\nFor example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view\\xa0sensory\\xa0set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles. Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is\\xa0a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars\\xa0at that intersection. As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities. This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPer an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nBryan Salesky, CEO of Argo AI, and as I’ve previously covered in my columns, is well-known for his focused mission of seeking to develop and deploy self-driving cars for the betterment of making getting around cities safer, easier, and more thoroughly enjoyable experience for all. By Argo AI actively participating in these kinds of birds-eye view efforts, the synergistic impact of leveraging such capabilities is undoubtedly an incremental step in that commendable path.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nOn the topic of off-road self-driving cars, here’s my details elicitation:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/off-roading-as-a-challenging-use-case-for-ai-autonomous-cars/\\xa0\\nI’ve urged that there must be a Chief Safety Officer at self-driving car makers, here’s the scoop:\\xa0https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/chief-safety-officers-needed-in-ai-the-case-of-ai-self-driving-cars/\\xa0\\nExpect that lawsuits are going to gradually become a significant part of the self-driving car industry, see my explanatory details here:\\xa0http://aitrends.com/selfdrivingcars/self-driving-car-lawsuits-bonanza-ahead/\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOverall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.\\xa0\\xa0\\nI mention that this should be considered an\\xa0add-on\\xa0since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available. This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.\\xa0\\nThere are other twists and turns to be considered.\\xa0\\nFor example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day. The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established. Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).\\xa0\\nThe key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place. The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue. You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such\\xa0as including perhaps\\xa0radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne last quick point for the moment on this topic:\\xa0There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nFor example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns). A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective. This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.\\xa0\\nAll of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view. Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)? Etc.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place. At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data. On and on this matter goes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having?\\xa0\\nSuppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSimilarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSpeaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout).\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nMaybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nYou could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.\\xa0\\nCopyright 2021 Dr. Lance Eliot\\xa0\\xa0http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website\\xa0'"

              "Predictive maintenance (PdM) has emerged as a killer AI app.</mark> <mark>In the past five years, predictive maintenance has moved from a niche use case to a fast-growing, high return on investment (ROI) application that is delivering true value to users.</mark> <mark>These developments are an indication of the power of the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI together, a market considered in its infancy today.</mark> <mark>These observations are from research conducted by IoT Analytics, consultants who supply market intelligence, which recently estimated that the $6.9 billion predictive maintenance market will reach $28.2 billion by 2026.</mark> <mark>The company began its research coverage of the IoT-driven predictive maintenance market in 2016, at an industry maintenance conference in Dortmund, Germany.</mark> <mark>Not much was happening.</mark> “We were bitterly disappointed,” stated Knud Lasse Lueth, CEO at IoT Analytics, in an account in IoT Business News. <mark>“Not a single exhibitor was talking about predictive maintenance.”  \n",
              "Things have changed.</mark> <mark>IoT Analytics analyst Fernando Alberto Brügge stated, “Our research in 2021 shows that predictive maintenance has clearly evolved from the rather static condition-monitoring approach.</mark> <mark>It has become a viable IoT application that is delivering overwhelmingly positive ROI.” \n",
              "Technical developments that have contributed to the market expansion include: a simplified process for connecting IoT assets, major advances in cloud services, and improvements in the accessibility of machine learning/data science frameworks, the analysts state.</mark> <mark>Along with the technical developments, the predictive maintenance market has seen a steady increase in the number of software and service providers offering solutions.</mark> IoT Analytics identified about 100 companies in the space in 2016; today the company identifies 280 related solution providers worldwide. Many of them are startups who recently entered the field. Established providers including GE, PTC, Cisco, ABB, and Siemens, have entered the market in the past five years, many through acquisitions. <mark>The market still has room; the analysts predict 500 companies will be in the business in the next five years.</mark> <mark>In 2016, the ROI from predictive analytics was unclear.</mark> <mark>In 2021, a survey of about 100 senior IT executives from the industrial sector found that predictive maintenance projects have delivered a positive ROI in 83% of the cases.</mark> <mark>Some 45% of those reported amortizing their investments in less than a year.</mark> <mark>“This data demonstrated how attractive the investment has become in recent years,” the analysts stated.</mark> More IoT Sensors Means More Precision \n",
              "Implemented projects that the analysts studied in 2016 relied on a limited number of data sources, typically one sensor value, such as vibration or temperature. <mark>Projects described in the 2021 report described 11 classes of data sources, such as data from existing sensors or data from the controllers.</mark> As more sources are tapped, the precision of the predictions increase, the analysts state. Many projects today are using hybrid modeling approaches that rely on domain expertise, virtual sensors and augmented data. AspenTech and PARC are two suppliers identified in the report as embracing hybrid modeling approaches. AspenTech has worked with over 60 companies to develop and test hybrid models that combine physics with ML/data science knowledge, enhancing prediction accuracy. The move to edge computing is expected to further benefit predictive modeling projects, by enabling algorithms to run at the point where data is collected, reducing response latency. The supplier STMicroelectronics recently introduced some smart sensor nodes that can gather data and do some analytic processing. More predictive maintenance apps are being integrated with enterprise software systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance  management systems (CMMS). <mark>Litmus Automation offers an integration service to link to any industrial asset, such as a programmable logic controller, a distributed control system, or a supervisory control and data acquisition system.</mark> <mark>Reduced Downtime Results in Savings \n",
              "Gains come from preventing downtime.</mark> “Predictive maintenance is the result of monitoring operational equipment and taking action to prevent potential downtime or an unexpected or negative outcome,” stated Mike Leone, an analyst at IT strategy firm Enterprise Strategy Group, in an account from TechTarget. Felipe Parages, Senior Data Scientist, Valkyrie\n",
              "Advances that have made predictive maintenance more practical today include sensor technology becoming more widespread, and the ability to monitor industrial machines in real time, stated Felipe Parages, senior data scientist at Valkyrie, data sense consultants. <mark>With more sensors, the volume of data has grown exponentially, and data analytics via cloud services has become available.</mark> It used to be that an expert had to perform an analysis to determine if a machine was not operating in an optimal way. “Nowadays, with the amount of data you can leverage and the new techniques based on machine learning and AI, it is possible to find patterns in all that data, things that are very subtle and would have escaped notice by a human being,” stated Parages. As a result, one person can now monitor hundreds of machines, and companies are accumulating historical data, which enables deeper trend analysis. <mark>“Predictive maintenance “is a very powerful weapon,” he stated.</mark> In an example project, Italy’s primary rail operator, Trenitalia, adopted predictive maintenance for its high-speed trains. The system is expected to save eight to 10% of an annual maintenance budget of 1.3 billion Euros, stated Paul Miller, an analyst with research firm Forrester, which recently issued a report on the project. <mark>“They can eliminate unplanned failures which often provide direct savings in maintenance but just as importantly, by taking a train out of service before it breaks—that means better customer service and happier customers,” Miller stated.</mark> He recommended organizations start out with predictive maintenance by fielding a pilot project. <mark>In an example of the types of cooperation predictive maintenance projects are expected to engender, the CEOs of several European auto and electronics firms recently announced plans to join forces to form the “Software Republique,” a new ecosystem for innovation in intelligent mobility.</mark> Atos, Dassault Systèmes, Groupe Renault, and STMicroelectronics and Thales announced their decision to pool their expertise to accelerate the market. <mark>Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer, Groupe Renault\n",
              "Luca de Meo, Chief Executive Officer of Groupe Renault, stated in a press release from STMicroelectronics, “In the new mobility value chain, on-board intelligence systems are the new driving force, where all research and investment are now concentrated.</mark> Faced with this technological challenge, we are choosing to play collectively and openly. <mark>There will be no center of gravity, the value of each will be multiplied by others.</mark> The combined expertise in cybersecurity, microelectronics, energy and data management will enable us to develop unique, cutting-edge solutions for low-carbon, shared, and responsible mobility, made in Europe.”    \n",

              "NVIDIA on May 6 detailed a partnership with the US Postal Service underway for over a year to speed up mail service using AI, with a goal of reducing current processing time tasks that take days to hours.</mark> <mark>The project fields edge servers at 195 Post Services sites across the nation, which review 20 terabytes of images a day from 1,000 mail processing machines, according to a post on the NVIDIA blog.</mark> <mark>Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal, Nvidia\n",
              "“The federal government has been for the last several years talking about the importance of artificial intelligence as a strategic imperative to our nation, and as an important funding priority.</mark> <mark>It’s been talked about in the White House, on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon.</mark> <mark>It’s been funded by billions of dollars, and it’s full of proof of concepts and pilots,” stated Anthony Robbins, Vice President of Federal for NVIDIA, in an interview with Nextgov.</mark> <mark>“And this is one of the few enterprise–wide examples of an artificial intelligence deployment that I think can serve to inspire the whole of the federal government.”  \n",
              "The project started with USPS AI architect at the time Ryan Simpson, who had the idea to try to expand an image analysis system a postal team was developing, into something much bigger, according to the blog post.</mark> (Simpson worked for USPS for over 12 years, and moved to NVIDIA as a senior data scientist eight months ago.) He believed that a system could analyze billions of images each center generated, and gain insights expressed in a few data points that could be shared quickly over the network. In a three-week sprint, Simpson worked with half a dozen architects at NVIDIA and others to design the needed deep-learning models. <mark>The work was done within the Edge Computing Infrastructure Program (ECIP), a distributed edge AI system up and running on Nvidia’s EGX platform at USPS.</mark> The EGX platform enables existing and modern, data-intensive applications to be accelerated and secure on the same infrastructure, from data center to edge. <mark>“It used to take eight or 10 people several days to track down items, now it takes one or two people a couple of hours,” stated Todd Schimmel, Manager, Letter Mail Technology, USPS.</mark> He oversees USPS systems including ECIP, which uses NVIDIA-Certified edge servers from Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. <mark>In another analysis, a computer vision task that would have required two weeks on a network of servers with 800 CPUs can now get done in 20 minutes on the four NVIDIA V100 Tensor Core GPUs in one of the HPE Apollo 6500 servers.</mark> <mark>Contract Awarded in 2019 for System Using OCR  \n",
              "USPS had put out a request for proposals for a system using optical character recognition (OCR) to streamline its imaging workflow.</mark> <mark>“In the past, we would have bought new hardware, software—a whole infrastructure for OCR; or if we used a public cloud service, we’d have to get images to the cloud, which takes a lot of bandwidth and has significant costs when you’re talking about approximately a billion images,” stated Schimmel.</mark> AI algorithms were developed on these NVIDIA DGX servers at a US Postal Service Engineering facility. <mark>(Credit: Nvidia)\n",
              "Today, the new OCR application will rely on a deep learning model in a container on ECIP managed by Kubernetes, the open source container orchestration system, and served by NVIDIA Triton, the company’s open-source inference-serving software.</mark> Triton allows teams to deploy trained AI models from any framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The deployment was very streamlined,” Schimmel stated. <mark>“We awarded the contract in September 2019, started deploying systems in February 2020 and finished most of the hardware by August—the USPS was very happy with that,” he added \n",
              "Multiple models need to communicate to the USPS OCR application to work.</mark> <mark>The app that checks for mail items alone requires coordinating the work of more than a half dozen deep-learning models, each checking for specific features.</mark> And operators expect to enhance the app with more models enabling more features in the future. <mark>“The models we have deployed so far help manage the mail and the Postal Service—they help us maintain our mission,” Schimmel stated.</mark> One model, for example, automatically checks to see if a package carries the right postage for its size, weight, and destination. Another one that will automatically decipher a damaged barcode could be online this summer. “We’re at the very beginning of our journey with edge AI. Every day, people in our organization are thinking of new ways to apply machine learning to new facets of robotics, data processing and image handling,” he stated. <mark>Accenture Federal Services, Dell Technologies, and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise contributed to the USPS OCR system incorporating AI, Robbins of NVIDIA stated.</mark> Specialized computing cabinets—or nodes—that contain hardware and software specifically tuned for creating and training ML models, were installed at two data centers. <mark>“The AI work that has to happen across the federal government is a giant team sport,” Robbins stated to Nextgov.</mark> <mark>“And the Postal Service’s deployment of AI across their enterprise exhibited just that.” \n",
              "The new solutions could help the Postal Service improve delivery standards, which have fallen over the past year.</mark> In mid-December, during the last holiday season, the agency delivered as little as 62% of first-class mail on time—the lowest level in years, according to an account in VentureBeat . The rate rebounded to 84% by the week of March 6 but remained below the agency’s target of about 96%. The Postal Service has blamed the pandemic and record peak periods for much of the poor service performance.

              "New laws will soon shape how companies use AI.</mark> <mark>The five largest federal financial regulators in the US recently released a request for information how banks use AI, signaling that new guidance is coming for the finance business.</mark> <mark>Soon after that, the US Federal Trade Commission released a set of guidelines on “truth, fairness and equity” in AI, defining the illegal use of AI as any act that “causes more harm than good,” according to a recent account in Harvard Business Review.</mark> <mark>And on April 21, the European Commission issued its own proposal for the regulation of AI (See AI Trends, April 22, 2021)  \n",
              "Andrew Burt, Managing Partner, bnh.ai\n",
              "While we don’t know what these regulation will allow, “Three central trends unite nearly all current and proposed laws on AI, which means that there are concrete actions companies can undertake right now to ensure their systems don’t run afoul of any existing and future laws and regulations,” stated article author Andrew Burt, the managing partner of bnh.ai, a boutique law firm focused on AI and analytics.</mark> First, conduct assessments of AI risks. As part of the effort, document how the risks have been minimized or resolved. Regulatory frameworks that refer to these “algorithmic impact assessments,” or “IA for AI,” are available. For example, Virginia’s recently-passed Consumer Data Protection Act, requires assessments for certain types of high-risk algorithms. <mark>The EU’s new proposal requires an eight-part technical document to be completed for high-risk AI systems that outlines “the foreseeable unintended outcomes and sources of risks” of each AI system, Burt states.</mark> The EU proposal is similar to the Algorithmic Accountability Act filed in the US Congress in 2019. The bill did not go anywhere but is expected to be reintroduced. Second, accountability and independence. This suggestion is that the data scientists, lawyers and others evaluating the AI system have different incentives than those of the frontline data scientists. This could mean that the AI is tested and validated by different technical personnel than those who originally developed it, or organizations may choose to hire outside experts to assess the AI system. <mark>“Ensuring that clear processes create independence between the developers and those evaluating the systems for risk is a central component of nearly all new regulatory frameworks on AI,” Burt states.</mark> Third, continuous review. AI systems are “brittle and subject to high rates of failure,” with risks that grow and change over time, making it difficult to mitigate risk at a single point in time. “Lawmakers and regulators alike are sending the message that risk management is a continual process,” Burt stated. <mark>Approaches in US, Europe and China Differ  \n",
              "The approaches between the US, Europe and China toward AI regulation differ in their approach, according to a recent account in The Verdict, based on analysis by Global Data, the data analytics and consulting company based in London.</mark> “Europe appears more optimistic about the benefits of regulation, while the US has warned of the dangers of over regulation,”’ the account states. <mark>Meanwhile, “China continues to follow a government-first approach” and has been widely criticized for the use of AI technology to monitor citizens.</mark> The account noted examples in the rollout by Tencent last year of an AI-based credit scoring system to determine the “trust value” of people, and the installation of surveillance cameras outside people’s homes to monitor the quarantine imposed after the breakout of COVID-19. <mark>“Whether the US’ tech industry-led efforts, China’s government-first approach, or Europe’s privacy and regulation-driven approach is the best way forward remains to be seen,” the account stated.</mark> <mark>In the US, many companies are aware of the risk of new AI regulation that could stifle innovation and their ability to grow in the digital economy, suggested a recent report from pwc, the multinational professional services firm.</mark> “It’s in a company’s interests to tackle risks related to data, governance, outputs, reporting, machine learning and AI models, ahead of regulation,” the pwc analysts state. They recommended business leaders assemble people from across the organization to oversee accountability and governance of technology, with oversight from a diverse team that includes members with business, IT and specialized AI skills. <mark>Critics of European AI Act Cite Too Much Gray Area \n",
              "While some argue that the European Commission’s proposed AI Act leaves too much gray area, the hope of the European Commission is that their proposed AI Act will provide guidance for businesses wanting to pursue AI, as well as a degree of legal certainty.</mark> <mark>Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market\n",
              "“Trust… we think is vitally important to allow the development we want of artificial intelligence,” stated Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, in an account in TechCrunch.</mark> AI applications “need to be trustworthy, safe, non-discriminatory — that is absolutely crucial — but of course we also need to be able to understand how exactly these applications will work.” \n",
              "“What we need is to have guidance. Especially in a new technology… We are, we will be, the first continent where we will give guidelines—we’ll say ‘hey, this is green, this is dark green, this is maybe a little bit orange and this is forbidden’. <mark>So now if you want to use artificial intelligence applications, go to Europe!</mark> <mark>You will know what to do, you will know how to do it, you will have partners who understand pretty well and, by the way, you will come also to the continent where you will have the largest amount of industrial data created on the planet for the next ten years.” \n",
              "“So come here—because artificial intelligence is about data—we’ll give you the guidelines.</mark> We will also have the tools to do it and the infrastructure,” Breton suggested. <mark>Another reaction was that the Commission’s proposal has overly broad exemptions, such as for law enforcement to use remote biometric surveillance including facial recognition technology, and it does not go far enough to address the risk of discrimination.</mark> <mark>Reactions to the Commission’s proposal included plenty of criticism of overly broad exemptions for law enforcement’s use of remote biometric surveillance (such as facial recognition tech) as well as concerns that measures in the regulation to address the risk of AI systems discriminating don’t go nearly far enough.</mark> <mark>“The legislation lacks any safeguards against discrimination, while the wide-ranging exemption for ‘safeguarding public security’ completely undercuts what little safeguards there are in relation to criminal justice,” stated Griff Ferris, legal and policy officer for Fair Trials, the global criminal justice watchdog based in London.</mark> <mark>“The framework must include rigorous safeguards and restrictions to prevent discrimination and protect the right to a fair trial.</mark> <mark>This should include restricting the use of systems that attempt to profile people and predict the risk of criminality.”  \n",
              "To accomplish this, he suggested, “The EU’s proposals need radical changes to prevent the hard-wiring of discrimination in criminal justice outcomes, protect the presumption of innocence and ensure meaningful accountability for AI in criminal justice.” \n",

              "Cyberattacks and identity fraud losses increased dramatically in 2020 as the pandemic made remote work the norm, setting the stage for AI and biometrics to combine in efforts to attain a higher level of protection.</mark> <mark>One study found banks worldwide saw a 238% jump in cyberattacks between February and April 2020; a study from Javelin Strategy & Research found that identity fraud losses grew to $56 billion last year as fraudsters used stolen personal information to create synthetic identities, according to a recent account from Pymnts.com.</mark> <mark>In addition, automated bot attacks shot upward by 100 million between July and December, targeting companies in a range of industries.</mark> <mark>Companies striving for better protection risk making life more difficult for their customers; another study found that 40% of financial institutions frequently mistake the online actions of legitimate customers to those of fraudsters.</mark> <mark>Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud, Stash Financial\n",
              "“As we look toward the post-pandemic—or, more accurately, inter-pandemic—era, we see just how good fraudsters were at using synthetic identities to defeat manual and semi-manual onboarding processes,” stated Caleb Callahan, Vice President of Fraud at Stash Financial of New York, offering a personal finance app, in an interview with Pymnts.</mark> SIM Sway Can Create a Synthetic Identity  \n",
              "One technique for achieving a synthetic identity is a SIM swap, in which someone contacts your wireless carrier and is able to convince the call center employee that they are you, using personal data that may have been exposed in hacks, data breaches or information publicly shared on social networks, according to an account on CNET. Once your phone number is assigned to a new card, all of your incoming calls and text messages will be routed to whatever phone the new SIM card is in. Identity theft losses were $712.4 billion-plus in 2020, up 42% from 2019, Callahan stated. “To be frank, our defenses are fragmented and too dependent on technologies such as SMS [texting] that were never designed to provide secure services. Banks and all businesses should be looking at how to unify data signals and layer checkpoints in order to keep up with today’s sophisticated fraudsters,” he stated. <mark>Asked what tools and technologies would help differentiate between fraudsters and legitimate customers, Callahan stated, “in an ideal world, we would have a digital identity infrastructure that banks and others could depend on, but I think that we are some ways away from that right now.”  \n",
              "Going forward, “The needs of the travel and hospitality, health, education and other sectors might accelerate the evolution of infrastructure for safety and security,” Callahan foresees.</mark> <mark>AI and Biometrics Seen as Offering Security Advantages \n",
              "AI can be employed to protect digital identity fraud, such as by offering greater accuracy and speed when it comes to verifying a person’s identity, or by incorporating biometric data so that a cybercriminal would not be able to gain access to information by only providing credentials, according to an account in Forbes.</mark> <mark>Deepak Gupta, Cofounder and CTO, LoginRadius\n",
              "“AI has the power to save the world from digital identity fraud,” stated Deepak Gupta, author of the Forbes article and cofounder and CTO of LoginRadius, a cloud-based consumer identity platform.</mark> “In the fight against ID theft, it is already a strong weapon. AI systems are entirely likely to end the reign of the individual hacker.”  \n",
              "While he sees AI authentication as being in an early phase, Gupta recommended that companies examine the following: the use of intelligent adaptive authentication, such as local and device fingerprint; biometric authentication, based on the face or fingerprints; and smart data filters. “A well-developed AI protection system will have the ability to respond in nanoseconds to close a leak,” he stated. Pandemic Altered Consumer Financial Behavior, Spurred Identity Fraud  \n",
              "The global pandemic has had a dramatic impact on consumer financial behavior. Consumers spent more time at home in 2020, transacted less than in previous years, and relied heavily on streaming services, digital commerce, and payments. They also corresponded more via email and text, for both work and personal life. <mark>“The pandemic inspired a major shift in how criminals approach fraud,” stated John Buzzard, Lead Analyst, Fraud & Security, with Javelin Strategy & Research in a press release.</mark> “Identity fraud has evolved and now reflects the lengths criminals will take to directly target consumers in order to steal their personally identifiable information.” \n",
              "Companies made quick adjustments to their business models, such as by increasing remote interactions with borrowers for loan originations and closings, and criminals pounced on new vulnerabilities they discovered. Nearly one-third of identity fraud victims say their financial services providers did not satisfactorily resolve their problems, and 38% of victims closed their accounts because of lack of resolution, the Javelin researchers found. <mark>“It is clear that financial institutions must continue to proactively and transparently manage fraud as a means to deepen their customer relationships,” stated Eric Kraus, Vice President and General Manager of Fraud, Risk and Compliance, FIS.</mark> The company offers technology solutions for merchants, banks, and capital markets firms globally. <mark>“Through our continuing business relationships with financial institutions, we know firsthand that consumers are looking to their banks to resolve instances of fraud, regardless of how the fraud occurred,” he added.</mark> This push from consumers who are becoming increasingly savvy online will lay a foundation for safer digital transactions. <mark>“Static forms of consumer authentication must be replaced with a modern, standards-based approach that utilizes biometrics,” stated David Henstock, Vice President of Identity Products at Visa, the world’s leader in digital payments.</mark> <mark>“Businesses benefit from reduced customer friction, lower abandonment rates and fewer chargebacks, while consumers benefit from better fraud prevention and faster payment during checkout.” \n",

              "Our lives are filled with explanations. You go to see your primary physician due to a sore shoulder. The doctor tells you to rest your arm and avoid any heavy lifting. In addition, a prescription is given. <mark>You immediately wonder why you would need to take medication and also are undoubtedly interested in knowing what the medical diagnosis and overall prognosis are.</mark> So, you ask for an explanation. In a sense, you have just opened a bit of Pandora’s box, at least in regard to the nature of the explanation that you might get. <mark>For example, the medical doctor could rattle a lengthy and jargon-filled indication of shoulder anatomy and dive deeply into the chemical properties of the medication that has been prescribed.</mark> That’s probably not the explanation you were seeking. <mark>It used to be that physicians did not expect patients to ask for explanations.</mark> <mark>Whatever was said by the doctor was considered sacrosanct.</mark> The very nerve of asking for an explanation was tantamount to questioning the veracity of a revered medical opinion. <mark>Some doctors would gruffly tell you to simply do as they have instructed (no questions permitted) or might utter something rather insipid like your shoulder needs help and this is the best course of action.</mark> <mark>Period, end of story.</mark> <mark>Nowadays, medical doctors are aware of the need for viable explanations.</mark> There is specialized “bedside” training that takes place in medical schools. <mark>Hospitals have their own in-house courses.</mark> Upcoming medical doctors are graded on how they interact with patients. <mark>And so on.</mark> Though that certainly has opened the door toward improved interaction with patients, it does not necessarily completely solve the explanations issue. <mark>Knowing how to best provide an explanation is both art and science.</mark> <mark>You need to consider that there is the explainer that will be providing the explanation, and there is a person that will be the recipient of the explanation.</mark> Explanations come in all shapes and sizes. <mark>A person seeking an explanation might have in mind that they want a fully elaborated explanation, containing all available bells and whistles.</mark> The person giving the explanation might in their mind be thinking that the appropriate explanation is short and sweet. There you have it, an explanation mismatch brewing right before our eyes. <mark>The explainer might do a crisp explanation and be happily satisfied with their explanation.</mark> Meanwhile, the person receiving the explanation is entirely dissatisfied. <mark>At this point, the person that received the explanation could potentially grit their teeth and just figure that this is all they are going to get.</mark> <mark>They might silently walk away and be darned upset, opting to not try and fight city hall, as it were, and merely accede to the minimal explanation proffered.</mark> Perhaps the person receiving the explanation decides they would like to get a more elaborated version. They might stand their ground and ask for a more in-depth explanation. <mark>Now we need to consider what the explainer is going to do.</mark> The explainer might believe that the explanation was more than sufficient, and see no need to provide any additional articulation. The explainer might be confused about why the initial explanation was not acceptable. Maybe the person receiving the explanation wasn’t listening or had failed to grasp the meaning of the words spoken. At this juncture, the explainer might therefore decide to repeat the same explanation that was just given and do so to ensure that the person receiving the original explanation really understood what was said. <mark>You can likely anticipate that this is about to spiral out of control.</mark> The person that is receiving this “elaborate” explanation is bound to notice that it is the same explanation repeated, nearly verbatim. That’s insulting! The person receiving the explanation now believes they are being belittled by the explainer. <mark>Either this person will hold their own tongue and give up trying to get an explanation, or try hurtling insults about how absurd an explanation the explanation was.</mark> <mark>It can devolve into a messy affair, that’s for sure.</mark> <mark>There is a delicate dance between the explainer and the providing of an explanation, along with the receiver and the desired nature of an explanation.</mark> <mark>We usually take these differences for granted.</mark> <mark>You rarely see an explainer ask what kind of explanation someone wants to have.</mark> <mark>Instead, the explainer launches into whatever semblance of an explanation that they assume the person would find useful.</mark> <mark>Rushing into providing an explanation can have its benefits, though it can also start an unsightly verbal avalanche that is going to take down both the explainer and the person receiving the explanation.</mark> Some suggest that the explainer ought to start by inquiring about the type of explanation that the other person is seeking. This might include asking what kind of background the other person has, in the case of a medical diagnosis, whether the other person is familiar with medical terminology and the field of medicine. There might also be a gentle inquiry as to whether the explanation should be done in one fell swoop or possibly divided into bite-sized pieces. <mark>Etc.</mark> <mark>The difficulty with that kind of pre-game formation is that sometimes the receiver doesn’t want to go through that gauntlet.</mark> <mark>They just want an explanation (or so they say).</mark> <mark>Trying to do a preamble is likely to irritate that receiver, and they will feel as though the explanation is being purposely delayed.</mark> This could even smack of hiding from the facts or some other nefarious basis for delaying the explanation. All told, we expect to get an explanation when we ask for one, and not have to go through a vast checklist beforehand. <mark>Another twist to all of this entails the interactive dialogue that can occur during explanations.</mark> The manner of explanations is not necessarily done in a one-breath fashion from start to end. Instead, it is more likely that during the explanation, the receiver will interrupt and ask for clarification or have questions that arise. <mark>This is certainly a sensible aspect.</mark> If the explanation is going awry, why have it go on and on, wherein instead the receiver can hopefully tailor or reshape the direction and style of the explanation. For example, suppose that you are a medical professional and have gone to see a medical doctor about your sore shoulder. <mark>Imagine that the doctor doing the diagnosis does not realize that the patient is a fellow medical specialist.</mark> In that case, the explanation offered is likely to be aimed at a presumed non-medical knowledge base and proceed in potentially simplistic ways (with respect to medical advice). The person receiving the explanation would undoubtedly interrupt and clarify that they know about medicine and the explanation should be readjusted accordingly. You might be tempted to believe that explanations can be rated as being either good or bad. Though you could take such a perspective, the general notion is that explanations and their beauty are in the eye of the beholder. One person’s favored explanation might be a disastrous or terrible one for someone else. That being said, there is still a modicum of a basis for assessing explanations and comparing them to each other. We can add a twist on that twist. Suppose you receive an explanation and believe it to be a good one. Later on, you learn something else regarding the matter and realize that the explanation was perhaps incomplete. Worse still, it could be that the explanation was intentionally warped to give you a false impression of a given situation. <mark>In short, an explanation can be used to purposely create falsehoods.</mark> That’s why getting an explanation is replete with problems. We often assume that if we ask for an explanation, and if it seems plausible, this attests that the matter is well-settled and above board. The thing is, an explanation can be distorted, either by design or by happenstance, and lead us into a false sense of veracity or truthfulness at hand. Another angle to explanations deals with asking for an explanation versus being given an explanation when it has not been requested. An explainer might give you an explanation outright because they assume you want one, whereas you are satisfied to just continue on. At that point, if you disrupt the explanation, the explainer might be taken aback. <mark>Why all this talk about explanations?</mark> <mark>Because of AI.</mark> <mark>The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in everyday computer systems is taking us down a path whereby the computer makes choices and we the humans have to live with those decisions.</mark> If you apply for a home loan, and an AI-based algorithm turns you down, the odds are that all you’ll know is that you did not get the loan. You won’t have any idea about why you were denied the loan. <mark>Presumably, had you consulted with a human that was doing the loan granting, you might have been able to ask them to explain why you got turned down.</mark> Note that this is not always the case, and it could be that the human would not be willing or able to explain the matter. The loan granting person might shrug their shoulders and say they have no idea why you were turned down, or they might tell you that company policy precludes them from giving you an explanation. <mark>Ergo, I am not suggesting that just because a human is in the loop you will necessarily get an explanation.</mark> Plus, as repeatedly emphasized earlier, the explanation might be rather feeble and altogether useless. In any case, there is a big hullabaloo these days that AI systems ought to be programmed to provide explanations for whatever they are undertaking. <mark>This is known as Explainable AI (XAI).</mark> XAI is growing quickly as an area of keen interest. People using AI systems are going to likely expect and somewhat demand that they get an explanation provided to them. <mark>Since the number of AI systems is rapidly growing, there is going to be a huge appetite for having a machine-produced explanation about what the AI has done or is doing.</mark> The rub is that oftentimes the AI is arcane and not readily amenable to generating an explanation. <mark>Take as an example the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).</mark> <mark>These are computational pattern matching algorithms that examine data and try to ferret out mathematical patterns.</mark> Sometimes the inner computational aspects are complex and do not lend themselves to being explained in any everyday human-comprehensible and logic-based way. This means that the AI is not intrinsically set up for providing explanations. <mark>In that case, there are usually attempts to add on an XAI component.</mark> This XAI either probes into the AI and tries to ferret out what took place, or it sits aside from the AI and has been preprogrammed to provide explanations based on what is assumed has occurred within the mathematically enigmatic mechanisms. <mark>Some assert that you ought to build the XAI into the core of whatever AI is being devised.</mark> <mark>Thus, rather than bolting onto the AI some afterthought about producing explanations, the design of the AI from the ground-up should encompass a proclivity to produce explanations.</mark> Amidst all of that technological pondering, there are the other aspects of what constitutes an explanation. If you revisit my earlier comments about how explanations tend to work, and the variability depending upon the explainer and the person receiving the explanation, you can readily see how difficult it might be to programmatically produce explanations. The cheapest way to go involves merely having pre-canned explanations. <mark>A loan granting system might have been set up with five explanations for why a loan was denied.</mark> <mark>Upon your getting turned down for the loan, you get shown one of those five explanations.</mark> <mark>There is no interaction.</mark> <mark>There is no particular semblance that the explanation is fitting or suitable to you in particular.</mark> Those are the pittance explanations. A more robust and respectable XAI capability would consist of generating explanations on the fly, in real-time, and do so based on the particular situation at hand. <mark>In addition, the XAI would try to ascertain what flavor or style of explanation would be suitable for the person receiving the explanation.</mark> <mark>And this explainer feature ought to allow for fluent interaction with the person getting the explanation.</mark> <mark>The receiver should be able to interrupt the explanation, getting the explainer or XAI to shift to other aspects or reshape the explanation based on what the person indicates.</mark> Of course, those are the same types of considerations that human explainers should also take into account. This brings up the fact that doing excellent XAI is harder than it might seem. In a manner of speaking, you are likely to need to use AI within the XAI in order to be able to simulate or mimic what a human explainer is supposed to be able to do (though, as we know, not all humans are adept at giving explanations). <mark>Shifting gears, you might be wondering what areas or applications could especially make use of XAI.</mark> <mark>One such field of endeavor entails Autonomous Vehicles (AVs).</mark> <mark>We are gradually going to have autonomous forms of mobility, striving toward a mobility-for-all mantra.</mark> <mark>There will be self-driving cars, self-driving trucks, self-driving motorcycles, self-driving submersibles, self-driving drones, self-driving planes, and the rest.</mark> <mark>You might at first thought be puzzled as to why AVs might need XAI.</mark> We can use self-driving cars to showcase how XAI is going to be a vital element for AVs. <mark>The question is this: In what way will Explainable AI (XAI) be important to the advent of AVs and as showcased via the emergence of self-driving cars?</mark> <mark>Let’s clarify what I mean by self-driving cars, and then we can jump further into the XAI AV discussion.</mark> <mark>For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/   \n",

              "As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task.</mark> <mark>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3.</mark> The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems). <mark>There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there.</mark> Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend). <mark>Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different from driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable).</mark> For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car. You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3. <mark>For why remote piloting or operating of self-driving cars is generally eschewed, see my explanation here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/remote-piloting-is-a-self-driving-car-crutch/   \n",

              "For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task.</mark> All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving. One aspect to immediately discuss entails the fact that the AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can. <mark>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</mark> <mark>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI.</mark> <mark>Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI.</mark> <mark>In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</mark> Now that we’ve laid the stage appropriately, time to dive into the myriad of aspects that come to play on this topic about XAI. First, be aware that many of the existing self-driving car tryouts have very little if any semblance of XAI in them. <mark>The initial belief was that people would get into a self-driving car, provide their destination, and be silently whisked to that locale.</mark> There would be no need for interaction with the AI driving system. There would be no need for an explanation or XAI capability. <mark>We can revisit that assumption by considering what happens when you use ridesharing and have a human driver at the wheel.</mark> There are certainly instances wherein you get into an Uber or Lyft vehicle and there is stony silence for the entirety of the trip. You’ve likely already provided the destination via the ride-request app. <mark>The person driving is intently doing the driving and ostensibly going to that destination.</mark> No need to chat. <mark>You can play video games on your smartphone and act as though there isn’t another human in the vehicle.</mark> That’s perfectly fine. <mark>Imagine though that during the driving journey, all of a sudden, the driver decides to go a route that you find unexpected or unusual.</mark> <mark>You might ask the driver why there is a change in the otherwise normal path to the destination.</mark> They would hopefully prompt an explanation from the human driver. <mark>It could be that the human driver gives you no explanation or provides a flimsy explanation.</mark> <mark>Humans do that.</mark> In theory, a properly done XAI will provide an on-target explanation, though this can be challenging. <mark>Maybe the human driver tells you that there is construction taking place on the main highway, and to avoid a lengthy delay, an alternative course is being undertaken.</mark> <mark>You might be satisfied with that explanation.</mark> <mark>On the other hand, perhaps you live in the area and are curious about the nature of the construction taking place.</mark> <mark>Thus, you ask the driver for further details about the construction.</mark> <mark>In a sense, you are interacting with an explainer and seeking additional nuances or facets about the explanation that was being provided.</mark> <mark>Okay, put on your self-driving car thinking-cap and consider what a passenger might want from an XAI.</mark> <mark>A self-driving car is taking you to your home.</mark> <mark>The normal path that would be used is unexpectedly diverted from the AI driving system.</mark> <mark>You are likely to want to ask the AI why the driving journey is altering from your expected traversal.</mark> Many of the existing tryouts of self-driving cars would not have any direct means of having the AI explain this matter, and instead, you would need to connect with a remote agent of the fleet operator that oversees the self-driving cars. In essence, rather than building the XAI, the matter is shunted over to a remote human to explain what is going on. <mark>This is something that won’t be especially scalable.</mark> <mark>In other words, once there are hundreds of thousands of self-driving cars on our roadways, the idea of having the riders always needing to contact a remote agent for the simplest of questions is going to be a huge labor cost and a logistics nightmare.</mark> <mark>There ought to be a frontline XAI that exists with the AI driving system.</mark> <mark>Assume that a Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface is coupled with the AI driving system, akin to the likes of Alexa or Siri.</mark> <mark>The passenger interacts with the NLP and can discuss common actions such as asking to change the destination midstream, or asking to swing through a fast-food eatery drive-thru, and so on.</mark> <mark>In addition, the passenger can ask for explanations.</mark> <mark>Suppose the AI driving system has to suddenly hit the brakes.</mark> The rider in the self-driving car might have been watching an especially fascinating cat video and not be aware of the roadway circumstances. After getting bounced around due to the harsh braking action, the passenger might anxiously ask why the AI driving system made such a sudden and abrasive driving action. <mark>You would want the AI to immediately provide such an explanation.</mark> <mark>If the only possible way to get an explanation involved seeking a remote agent, envision what that might be like.</mark> <mark>There you are, inside the self-driving car, and it has just taken radical action, but you have no idea why it did so.</mark> <mark>You have to press a button or somehow activate a call to a remote agent.</mark> <mark>This might take a few moments to engage.</mark> <mark>Once the remote agent is available (assuming that one is readily available), they might begin the dialogue with a usual canned speech, such as welcome to the greatest of all self-driving cars.</mark> You, meanwhile, have been sitting inside this self-driving car, which is still merrily driving along, and yet you have no clue why it out-of-the-blue hit the brakes. The point here is that by the time you engage in a discussion with the human remote operator, a lot of time and driving aspects could have occurred. During that delay, you are puzzled, concerned, and worried about what the AI driving system might crazily do next. <mark>If there was an XAI, perhaps you would have been able to ask the XAI what just happened.</mark> The XAI might instantly explain that there was a dog on the sidewalk that was running toward the self-driving car and appeared to be getting within striking distance. The AI driving system opted to do a fast braking action. The dog got the idea and safely scampered away. A timely explanation, and one that then gives the passenger solace and relief, allowing them to settle back into their seat and watch more of those videos about frisky kittens and adorable puppies. <mark>For more details about ODDs, see my indication at this link here: https://www.aitrends.com/ai-insider/amalgamating-of-operational-design-domains-odds-for-ai-self-driving-cars/ \n",

In fact, the likeliest question that self-driving cars are going to get is how does the AI driving system function. The XAI ought to be readied to cope with that kind of question. The one thing we probably should not expect XAI to handle will be those questions that are afield of the driving chore. For example, asking the XAI to explain the meaning of life is something that could be argued as out-of-bounds and above the pay grade of the AI.

              "Deepfake is a portmanteau of “deep learning” and “fake”, and refers to a synthetic media usually in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else’s likeness.</mark> <mark>Deepfakes use techniques from machine learning and AI to manipulate visual and audio content with a high potential to deceive.</mark> <mark>Deepfakes applied to geography have the potential to falsify satellite image data, which could pose a national security threat.</mark> <mark>Scientists at the University of Washington (UW) are studying this, in the hopes of finding ways to detect fake satellite images and warn of its dangers.</mark> <mark>Bo Zhao, Assistant Professor of Geography, University of Washington\n",
              "“This isn’t just Photoshopping things.</mark> <mark>It’s making data look uncannily realistic,” stated Bo Zhao, assistant professor of geography at the UW and lead author of the study, in a news release from the University of Washington.</mark> <mark>The study was published on April 21 in the journal Cartography and Geographic Information Science.</mark> “The techniques are already there. We’re just trying to expose the possibility of using the same techniques, and of the need to develop a coping strategy for it,” Zhao stated. Fake locations and other inaccuracies have been part of mapmaking since ancient times, due to the nature of translating real-life locations to map form. But some inaccuracies in maps are created by the mapmakers to prevent copyright infringement. <mark>National Geospatial Intelligence Agency Director Sounds Alarm\n",
              "Now with the prevalence of geographic information systems, Google Earth and other satellite imaging systems, the spoofing involves great sophistication and carries more risks.</mark> The director of the federal agency in charge of geospatial intelligence, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), sounded the alarm at an industry conference in 2019. “We’re currently faced with a security environment that is more complex, inter­connected, and volatile than we’ve experienced in recent memory—one which will require us to do things differently if we’re to navigate ourselves through it successfully,” stated NGA Director Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, according to an account from SpaceNews. <mark>To study how satellite images can be faked, Zhao and his team at WU used an AI framework that has been used to manipulate other types of digital files.</mark> When applied to the field of mapping, the algorithm essentially learns the characteristics of satellite images from an urban area, then generates a deepfake image by feeding the characteristics of the learned satellite image characteristics onto a different base map. The researchers employed a generative adversarial network machine learning framework to achieve this. The researchers combined maps and satellite images from three cities—Tacoma, Seattle and Beijing—to compare features and create new images of one city, drawn from the characteristics of the other two. The untrained eye may have difficulty detecting the differences between real and fake, the researchers noted. The researchers studied color histograms and frequency, texture, contrast, and spatial domains, to try to identify the fakes. Simulated satellite imagery can serve a legitimate purpose when used to represent how an area is affected by climate change over time, for example. If there are no images for a certain period, filling in the gaps to provide perspective can provide perspective. The simulations need to be labeled as such. The researchers hope to learn how to detect fake images, to help geographers develop data literacy tools, similar to fact-checking services. <mark>As technology continues to evolve, this study aims to encourage more holistic understanding of geographic data and information, so that we can demystify the question of absolute reliability of satellite images or other geospatial data, Zhao stated.</mark> “We also want to develop more future-oriented thinking in order to take countermeasures such as fact-checking when necessary,” he said. <mark>In an interview with The Verge, Zhao stated the aim of his study “is to demystify the function of absolute reliability of satellite images and to raise public awareness of the potential influence of deep fake geography.” He stated that although deepfakes are widely discussed in other fields, his paper is likely the first to touch upon the topic in geography.</mark> <mark>“While many GIS [geographic information system] practitioners have been celebrating the technical merits of deep learning and other types of AI for geographical problem-solving, few have publicly recognized or criticized the potential threats of deep fake to the field of geography or beyond,” stated the authors.</mark> <mark>US Army Researchers Also Working on Deepfake Detection\n",

The automation can also be used in bid preparation and project planning. <mark>“The goal is to help our business development, operations, and scheduling folks make more informed decisions based on historical data so everything is more scientific, rather than someone’s bad feeling about something,” Maha stated.</mark> <mark>Niran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder, Kwant.ai\n",
              "To get more usable site data, DPR has also been trying outfitting workers with wearables containing Internet of Things sensors from Kwant.ai, a New York City-based software supplier focused on jobsite intelligence.</mark> <mark>The system helps with worker location and scheduling, and the company is working on applying machine learning to its datasets.</mark> <mark>“We never try to sell this by saying it will solve all your problems, but if you input all the data it will provide insights for you to take action,” stated Niran Shrestha, CEO and Cofounder of Kwant.</mark> As part of a panel on AI in Construction held by the Ontario General Contractors Association last year, Shrestha offered some insight into how AI can help estimate the needed manpower on a construction site. <mark>“We still don’t know how much manpower is required if you want to build an airport, a railroad or commercial building,” he stated in an account in ConstructConnect.</mark> “When you are making a cost and schedule for a new project what do you do? You look at your older schedule, and you try to compare the schedule and see if you can use that as a reference for the new project, for estimation, for manpower and for cost. <mark>Now imagine with AI you are not comparing one or two schedules… but you’re looking at thousands and thousands of data points that you’ve collected historically for years and years.”  \n",
              "A project manager with Cambria Design Build, Ltd., Milad Khalili, also on the panel, stated that he saw the advantage of being able to access historical data quickly.</mark> <mark>“With the help of machine learning, AI and automation, you will have it so much faster and a few clicks away,” he stated.</mark> “It’s also going to help us eliminate the repetitive tasks that project managers, project coordinators, and different people and trades are doing at construction sites. <mark>You are saving a lot of time and money on labor and materials.”  \n",
              "Drones Increasingly Used for Site Surveys, Construction Planning  \n",
              "Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)  are being increasingly employed on construction sites, to monitor progress and safety and to survey sites prior to the first dirt being shoveled.</mark> <mark>Drones can provide detailed, high-resolution images, enabling engineers to pinpoint potential issues and allow for effective deployment of equipment during construction, according to a recent account in ForConstructionPros.com.</mark> Using drones to perform inspections also avoids the need to place workers at risk. <mark>“Simply put, drones enable us to provide needed views that are inaccessible, or otherwise too risky and expensive to capture by any other means,” stated Ryan Holmes, program manager of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for Multivista of Newton, Mass., which provides UAV/drone services with remote pilots on staff.</mark> “We are using drones to help anywhere, from assessing land clearing and earthwork, insurance coverage, inspections, through to project completion and maintenance thereafter,” he stated. The data gathered through the drone can usually be accessed on any platform, be it desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, giving project data flexibility. Many companies optimize raw drone data to produce more clear drone images. Real Time Kinematic (RTK) drones, for example, use a GPS-correction technology that provides real-time location data corrections when capturing photos of a site. <mark>“The rise of RTK drones has provided a major step forward in providing accurate, repeatable results in a straightforward workflow, reducing one of the largest potential error sources in the placement and processing of Ground Control Points (GCPs) on earthwork projects,” stated Matthew Desmond, president of Agtek of Livermore, Calif., a supplier of survey, analysis and control software for the heavy construction industry.</mark> Read the source articles and information  in the Engineering News-Record, in ConstructConnect and in ForConstructionPros.com.

              "  <mark>By Lance Eliot, the AI Trends Insider   \n",
              "When driving a car, you could really benefit from having a bird’s-eye view of the driving scene.</mark> Let’s explore why. Imagine that you are driving in a crowded and altogether hectic downtown area. There are humongous skyscraper buildings that are towering over you and ostensibly blocking any chance of seeing beyond an extremely narrow tunnel-vision perspective of the roadway. Among the visual obscurity, you cannot see anything on the streets that intersect with the road that you are currently driving on. <mark>Until you get directly into an intersection, you pretty much have no idea what is taking place on any of those perpendicular avenues that are to the left and right of you.</mark> You come to a corner that is packed with pedestrians and signposts, once again blocking your view, and decide to engage a rapid and sharp right turn. Just as you poke forward into the turn, you’ll have a very brief chance to glimpse whatever lies beyond. In that split second, you have to visually scan the entire driving scene and hope that you can mentally ascertain the considerations and contortions of whatever unknown menaces are looming ahead of you. <mark>For example, as you make the right turn, you might suddenly come upon a car that is unlawfully parked in the active lane.</mark> <mark>You didn’t see the halted car until making your turn, and could ram directly into the back of this reckless driver.</mark> Your mind races as you consider your options. You could hit the brakes, but this might get you violently rear-ended by a car that is closely following your turn. Another possibility would be to swing wide, going into the lane to the left of the illegally stopped car. But other traffic is using that lane, and your attempt to dart into their path could be catastrophic. You will either sideswipe one of those innocent cars or possibly disrupt their steady flow and produce a series of automotive-screeching cascading collisions. Sadly, neither option is satisfactory. This is the nature of driving. <mark>You are always on the edge of your seat because you are in the midst of continually making life-or-death decisions.</mark> Most people that sit down at the steering wheel are not actively thinking about the life-or-death matters involved in driving a car. Until they get themselves into a dicey driving situation, they take for granted the grim magnitude of the driving task. <mark>All it takes is for you to make the wrong decision, and you can end up striking other cars (or they could ram into you).</mark> <mark>Besides the likely damage to the vehicles, there is a viable chance of you getting injured, plus your passengers getting injured.</mark> There is also the likely chance of injuring the driver of the other car and the passengers in that vehicle. Regrettably, there is also the real chance of producing fatalities. The startling statistics are that about 40,000 car crash-related fatalities occur in the United States annually, along with approximately 2.3 million related injuries. Driving a car is dangerous, and yet we generally tend to downplay the risks. <mark>It sure would be handy if there were ways to reduce those risks.</mark> <mark>The example of making the right turn highlights especially the dismal conditions of driving when you are only able to see a small part of the overarching puzzle.</mark> Had you somehow been able to see or know that there was a car parked in the active turn lane, you would have been able to take proactive steps to avoid the crisis. <mark>What could you have done differently if you had a better semblance of the roadway situation?</mark> <mark>You might have come to a gradual stop before making the turn, which then presumably would have coaxed the car behind you to also slow down, thus reducing the risk of getting struck from behind.</mark> <mark>Alternatively, you might have chosen to not make the right turn at all, perhaps waiting to do so when you had driven down another block or two.</mark> <mark>In short, you would have had many more options available and been able to better make those life-or-death decisions if you had a macroscopic picture of the driving scene.</mark> Voila: the bird’s-eye view. Suppose that you had some kind of extending periscope that was attached to your car. This oddball contraption could allow you to look down those intersecting streets, giving you a brief heads-up before reaching the turn. <mark>That might work, but it doesn’t seem particularly practical.</mark> <mark>Imagine instead that you could somehow fly above the driving scene.</mark> There you are, sitting in your car at the steering wheel, simultaneously looking down upon the driving scene. Now that’s some kind of driving. <mark>Rather than relying upon a farfetched notion, we can be much more down-to-earth and consider everyday options that are viable right now.</mark> <mark>Assume that we mounted a camera above the intersection that you were aiming to make that right turn at.</mark> <mark>The camera could be doing real-time streaming and send the video to your in-car display.</mark> As such, you might glance at your in-car display and observe that a motionless car is sitting smack dab in the lane that you are expecting to use when you complete your right turn. Akin to the earlier emphasis about having crucial and timely beforehand options, you can make a wiser choice with this added vantage point. The idea of having a camera that overlooks an intersection is altogether practical and doable today. No magic is required. <mark>We might further increase the sensing capability by including other kinds of sensory devices.</mark> <mark>For example, we could include radar, LIDAR, thermal imaging, and so on.</mark> This array of sensors would allow for detecting the driving scene in a wide variety of conditions, such as even when it is foggy, raining, snowing, etc. That certainly seems tempting and a valuable way to give drivers an enhanced perspective about the driving scene. <mark>There are some potential downsides.</mark> A human driver has limitations on how much input they can absorb at once. Furthermore, their eyes can only usually be looking at thing at any given point in time. Thus, if you are looking down at an in-car display to see what is beyond the upcoming corner, the odds are that you’ve now taken your eyes off the road directly ahead of you. <mark>At that moment, you might not notice that a pedestrian has suddenly stepped into the street and you are about to run them over.</mark> <mark>The question arises as to how a human driver can take in extra information.</mark> <mark>This would have to be arranged in a fashion that would somehow keep your attention still riveted to the straight-ahead driving, and meanwhile allow for glimpsing what is beyond your ordinary viewpoint.</mark> Even if this could be arranged (perhaps via some kind of HUD or heads-up display), there is also the issue of making sense of this additional perspective. When you glance at the in-car display, you need to mentally analyze the added perspective and combine it with whatever you already have in your noggin about the driving scene. The odds are that people would have difficulty doing this, certainly at first try. <mark>Unless you had some specialized training or a lot of experience using this kind of perspective-augmenting facility, you would undoubtedly struggle.</mark> You might entirely ignore the secondary perspective. <mark>You might fail to spot the key elements in the secondary perspective that apply to your existing driving efforts.</mark> And so on. Some people would readily take to the feature, others might never make use of it (they could presumably disengage the feature and avoid using it). You can imagine how this would play out in societal terms. <mark>A person gets into a car crash and if they had used the augmented perspective, they perhaps would have been able to avoid the collision.</mark> <mark>They are then held culpable for not having used the capability.</mark> Likewise, somebody using the augmented perspective gets into a car crash, and the claim is made that the additional info was confusing or led the driver to somehow make a worse choice than if they had not been using the secondary perspective. <mark>Shifting gears, the future of cars consists of self-driving cars.</mark> <mark>Self-driving cars are going to be using AI-based driving systems and there won’t be a human driver at the wheel.</mark> Here is an intriguing question: Could AI-based true self-driving cars successfully leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene? <mark>Let’s unpack the matter and see.</mark> For my framework about AI autonomous cars, see the link here: https://aitrends.com/ai-insider/framework-ai-self-driving-driverless-cars-big-picture/ \n",

              "As a clarification, true self-driving cars are ones where the AI drives the car entirely on its own and there isn’t any human assistance during the driving task. <mark>These driverless vehicles are considered Level 4 and Level 5, while a car that requires a human driver to co-share the driving effort is usually considered at Level 2 or Level 3.</mark> <mark>The cars that co-share the driving task are described as being semi-autonomous, and typically contain a variety of automated add-on’s that are referred to as ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems).</mark> There is not yet a true self-driving car at Level 5, which we don’t yet even know if this will be possible to achieve, and nor how long it will take to get there. <mark>Meanwhile, the Level 4 efforts are gradually trying to get some traction by undergoing very narrow and selective public roadway trials, though there is controversy over whether this testing should be allowed per se (we are all life-or-death guinea pigs in an experiment taking place on our highways and byways, some contend).</mark> Since semi-autonomous cars require a human driver, the adoption of those types of cars won’t be markedly different than driving conventional vehicles, so there’s not much new per se to cover about them on this topic (though, as you’ll see in a moment, the points next made are generally applicable). <mark>For semi-autonomous cars, it is important that the public needs to be forewarned about a disturbing aspect that’s been arising lately, namely that despite those human drivers that keep posting videos of themselves falling asleep at the wheel of a Level 2 or Level 3 car, we all need to avoid being misled into believing that the driver can take away their attention from the driving task while driving a semi-autonomous car.</mark> You are the responsible party for the driving actions of the vehicle, regardless of how much automation might be tossed into a Level 2 or Level 3.

              "For Level 4 and Level 5 true self-driving vehicles, there won’t be a human driver involved in the driving task. <mark>All occupants will be passengers; the AI is doing the driving.</mark> The AI involved in today’s AI driving systems is not sentient. In other words, the AI is altogether a collective of computer-based programming and algorithms, and most assuredly not able to reason in the same manner that humans can. <mark>Why this added emphasis about the AI not being sentient?</mark> <mark>Because I want to underscore that when discussing the role of the AI driving system, I am not ascribing human qualities to the AI.</mark> Please be aware that there is an ongoing and dangerous tendency these days to anthropomorphize AI. <mark>In essence, people are assigning human-like sentience to today’s AI, despite the undeniable and inarguable fact that no such AI exists as yet.</mark> <mark>With that clarification, you can envision that the AI driving system won’t natively somehow “know” about how to leverage a bird’s-eye view perspective of the driving scene.</mark> <mark>This is an aspect that needs to be programmed as part of the hardware and software of the self-driving car (I’ve referred to this as part of the “computational omnipresence” that self-driving cars can potentially attain).</mark> <mark>Let’s dive into the myriad aspects that come to play on this topic.</mark> <mark>First, the AI driving system would have to contain some device or equipment that would receive the secondary perspective.</mark> <mark>As mentioned earlier, the bird’s-eye view electronics might contain a multitude of sensory devices.</mark> In addition, there would need to be an electronic communications capability to transmit the data being collected. In turn, any vehicle wishing to make use of the transmission would need to be equipped with an appropriate receiving device. <mark>The point is that the self-driving car would have to contain some form of hardware and software to receive the bird’s-eye view data.</mark> <mark>This might be undertaken by communications devices already on-board the vehicle, or there might need to be an added component installed into the self-driving car.</mark> Some might argue that this potentially adds an additional cost to the self-driving car. In that case, there would need to be an appropriate ROI (Return on Investment) calculated. <mark>Via a back-of-the-envelope kind of hunch, the odds are quite high that this ROI would be worthwhile since if the capability is well-implemented, it could boost the AI driving system safety and reduce the chances of self-driving cars getting into calamitous issues (something that I’ve discussed at length in my columns).</mark> Okay, so let’s assume that a self-driving car is equipped to receive the data streaming from the bird’s-eye view. <mark>We next need to consider the timeliness of the data.</mark> Suppose the data is time-delayed in being sent. <mark>As such, as the vehicle comes up to make a right turn, and yet the data is provided to the AI driving system is let’s suppose several seconds behind real-time.</mark> In that case, the somewhat outdated data is problematic. <mark>The driving scene might have already changed, and the AI driving system is trying to use stale data.</mark> That’s bound to create difficulties. <mark>In that sense, the data coming from the bird’s-eye view has to be timely to be considered especially valued.</mark> <mark>The latency is a factor.</mark> That being said, let’s clarify that a timing delay of a split-second might not fully undermine the value of the data, and likewise even a delay of several seconds would not necessarily obviate the value. <mark>The point is that though the timing is vital, at least if it is time-stamped, the AI driving system would presumably be programmed to take into account the recency of the data and give weight accordingly to what is being received.</mark> Some are suggesting that the use of 5G will be significant to this timing aspect. <mark>The next aspect for the AI driving system consists of programmatically intertwining the bird’s-eye view with the existent sensory data from the in-car onboard sensory suite.</mark> In essence, the self-driving car already has its own set of sensory devices. <mark>There is a computational analysis that takes place and is commonly referred to as Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF).</mark> <mark>You can consider the bird’s-eye view to be an added set of sensors that are now being applied to the otherwise customary MSDF computational effort of the AI driving system.</mark> <mark>Here’s something else to ponder.</mark> Suppose the bird’s-eye view provides the entirety of the raw data being collected. <mark>This could amount to extraordinarily voluminous transmissions, taking precious time to do so.</mark> <mark>Also, the self-driving car has to have sufficient computational processing capabilities to crunch through the data, once it has been received.</mark> All told, within the self-driving car, there has to be a lot of added or presumably available computing resources for undertaking this calculation-intensive effort. <mark>Plus, it will take time for that kind of data-related interpretation and processing to occur.</mark> You might be thinking, well, in that case, just transmit a shorthand version. <mark>Perhaps the bird’s eye system ought to have its own computing capabilities and pre-crunch the data.</mark> Instead of sending the streaming video of that car parked in the active lane, the bird’s-eye capability might just send a text message stating that a car is going to be blocking that upcoming turn. This seems readily usable, but it turns out that there are thorny consequential issues that arise. <mark>For example, is the car completely blocking the lane or only partially intruding into the lane?</mark> <mark>Is the car truly at a complete standstill or perhaps rolling forward slowly?</mark> A zillion questions can be imagined. <mark>Without the raw data, the AI driving system will be getting an incomplete semblance of what issues might be awaiting the self-driving car.</mark> <mark>There is a challenging tradeoff of whether to only transmit a shorthand notation versus the full set of data.</mark> <mark>I’ll throw you another curveball.</mark> <mark>Should the AI driving system entirely trust the data coming from the bird’s-eye view?</mark> <mark>On the one hand, this bird’s-eye view could be a tremendous asset.</mark> <mark>At the same time, suppose the data is delayed and is no longer viably accurate about the driving scene.</mark> <mark>Worse, suppose that the data coming from the sensors is corrupted or perhaps has been hacked.</mark> The key is that the AI driving system is considered “responsible” for the driving of the vehicle. As such, whatever the bird’s-eye view provides is not as vital as the aspects of what the AI driving system is going to do when undertaking the driving task. <mark>Without seeking to create an anthropomorphic analogy, recall that earlier I mentioned that human drivers might struggle to combine the bird’s-eye view with their own recognition of the driving scene.</mark> <mark>You could suggest that the AI driving system is in the same boat.</mark> That being said, the beauty of the AI driving system is that, unlike a human that can only provide attention to one thing at a time (i.e., looking at the roadway versus looking at an in-car display), the AI system can be doing those types of actions simultaneously. Assuming that there is sufficient processing speed available and that the software is well-written, the AI driving system ought to be able to analyze the totality of the perspectives that are available via the amalgamated data from the widened sensory indications. We can add more icing to that cake. It is expected that self-driving cars will be equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) electronic communications. This allows a self-driving car to send electronic messages to other nearby self-driving cars. For example, a self-driving car that perhaps made the right turn at the corner could send out a V2V cautioning that a car is parked just beyond that turn. <mark>Other nearby self-driving cars could receive the message, and the AI driving systems would accordingly (hopefully) be programmed to consider that added info.</mark> There is also going to be V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure). <mark>For example, traffic signals will be beaming out electronic messages.</mark> <mark>Thus, rather than having to rely solely on a visual indication of whether a traffic signal is green-yellow-red, this can be transmitted electronically.</mark> All told, a self-driving car is apt to have a plethora of outside info that will be flowing into the AI driving system. <mark>This data needs to be computationally examined.</mark> There needs to be a fusing of the data to try and determine what the driving scene consists of. Plus, the AI driving system cannot necessarily assume that all the data is valid or truthful. Some data will be, while perhaps other parts of the data might be noisy, corrupted, or otherwise have misleading indications. <mark>Various experimental or pilot uses of birds-eye view capabilities are taking place today.</mark> <mark>For example, Ford has devised a bird’s-eye view sensory set up in Miami Beach, doing so as part of the joint effort of Ford and Argo AI’s self-driving vehicles.</mark> Specifically, a busy intersection in South Beach that is known for especially being hectic has been selected for the tryout (the corner of Lincoln Road and Lenox Avenue). <mark>This selection makes sense since it will provide a plentiful opportunity to test the bird’s-eye capability (versus if a quiet and otherwise seldom-used intersection was chosen).</mark> <mark>The intersection is near an outdoor mall and lots of popular stores and eateries, so there is a bustling and ongoing flow of bicyclists, pedestrians, and human-driven cars at that intersection.</mark> <mark>As with any of these efforts, it is prudent to do so in conjunction with roadway and related authorities.</mark> <mark>This effort includes the Florida Department of Transportation, the City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County.</mark> Per an indication by Scott Griffith, CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and Mobility Businesses, this effort brings together the added pieces of the puzzle that underlay the emergence of self-driving cars, including the use of state-of-the-art infrastructure capabilities (see his LinkedIn coverage): “Bringing together the future of self-driving requires us to think about every piece of the puzzle. <mark>One part of this is researching emerging technologies, like smart infrastructure, to explore how we can provide our self-driving vehicles with as much information as possible to navigate complex urban areas.”   \n",

              "Overall, the bird’s-eye view provides a handy add-on for the advent of self-driving cars.</mark> <mark>I mention that this should be considered an add-on since the philosophical bent must be that an AI-based true self-driving car will still operate effectively without having a bird’s-eye view available.</mark> This is important due to the obvious aspect that many locales won’t have a birds-eye setup in place. <mark>In addition, there is always the chance that any such equipment might suddenly be disrupted or experience troubles, in which case the AI driving system has to be programmed to work as though the birds-eye view is no longer functional.</mark> <mark>There are other twists and turns to be considered.</mark> <mark>For example, assume that the bird’s-eye view is being operated 24×7, naturally so since cars can be coming through an intersection at any time of the day.</mark> <mark>The concern by some is that this is essentially a spying type of capability, one that can record the coming and going of people in whatever locale has the bird’s-eye view established.</mark> <mark>Yes, this is ostensibly the case, though keep in mind that we already have lots and lots of video cameras set up in many areas and the trend toward doing so continues to expand (partially due to the low-cost nature of today’s surveillance-style technologies).</mark> <mark>The key here is that the aspect of having a bird’s-eye view for car traffic is presumably not markedly different than if there were conventional video cameras put in place.</mark> <mark>The same kind of debate and qualms would ensue.</mark> <mark>You might try to argue that the added array of sensors makes the bird’s-eye capability somewhat different, such as including perhaps radar, LIDAR, and the like, though this seems not demonstratively indistinguishable for the overarching qualms involved per se.</mark> One last quick point for the moment on this topic: There are other means to gain a bird’s-eye view. <mark>For example, I’ve covered the use of autonomous drones that would work in concert with self-driving cars (see my coverage in my columns).</mark> <mark>A self-driving car might have a launchpad that can place into the air a drone, which then would fly around at the command of the AI driving system and provide sensory data from a bird’s-eye perspective.</mark> <mark>This could be done via the self-driving car capabilities, or there might be drones that are provided by others, such as a local roadway authority that has autonomous drones.</mark> <mark>All of the same issues earlier stated are likely to be encompassed by a drone-based bird’s-eye view.</mark> Will the AI driving system be programmed to make use of the drone-added perspective? <mark>Will the AI be programmed to deal with any faulty data coming from a drone (which could happen)?</mark> Etc. The privacy aspects also come to play, which can be worsened or lessened via the use of a drone. <mark>On the one hand, a drone is likely to be only temporarily in the skies, while a fixed-in-place bird’s-eye view mounted sensory equipment is likely to be somewhat permanently put in place.</mark> <mark>At the same time, realize that the drone could wander around and glean a likely wider swath of data.</mark> On and on this matter goes. The other futuristic consideration involves how many of these bird’s-eye views will we end up having? Suppose that an intersection has several bird’s-eye views that have been put in place. You could argue that this is fine since the more the merrier, on the other hand, the counterbalancing argument is that things are getting out-of-hand and too much can be overbearing and overwhelming. Similarly, when you consider the use of drones for a bird’s-eye view, just imagine if all the cars in a given area opted to launch their respective drones, you would seemingly have a sky utterly cluttered with a massive flock of such mechanical beasts. Anyway, we can certainly aim to start someplace, seeking to crawl before we walk, walk before we run, and run before we fly, so to speak. Speaking of birds and flying, when I was a youngster, I had a canary as a beloved pet. I used to dream about what the canary could see when it took flight (we would let it out of the cage in our house and allow the bird to cheerfully fly throughout). Maybe I could get another canary now and train it to carry around some sensory devices, proffering yet another means of getting a bird’s-eye view for self-driving cars. Besides toting around the sensors, perhaps it would sing those delightful warbling bird songs. And the costs to keep the canary on duty would be appealingly low, only requiring everyday birdseed. You could cheekily assert that the canary could forewarn about impending car collisions, serving as a veritable canary in a coal mine.
